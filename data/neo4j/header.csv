1000022,B,IEEE 802 networks may be used as IP networks of any class ( A   B   or C ). These systems use two Link Service Access Point ( LSAP ) fields of the LLC header in much the same way the ARPANET uses the " link " field . Further   there is an extension of the LLC header called the Sub-Network Access Protocol ( SNAP ). ,231,1042,field
1000023,B,The Broadcast Indicators are used to indicate the routing desired for a particular frame . A frame may be routed through a single specified route   through every distinct non-repeating route in a multi-ring network   or through a single route determined by a spanning tree algorithm such that the frame appears on every ring exactly once . The values which may be used at this time are ( in binary ): ,110,1042,field

1000028,r,These bits are reserved for future use and must be set to 0 by the transmitter and ignored by the receiver . ,500,1042,field
1000029,MsgDelivery,CoresidentEntity   MsgDelivery and SegmentSize fields are in use . The RequestCode field specifies the type of Request . It is analogous to a packet type field of the Ethernet   acting as a switch for higher-level protocols . The CoresidentEntity field   if used   designates a subgroup of the ServerEntityId group to which the Request should be routed   namely those members that are co-resident with the specified entity ( or entity group ). The primary intended use is to specify the manager for a particular service that is co-resident with a particular entity   using the well-known entity group identifier for the service manager in the ServerEntityId field and the identifier for the entity in the CoresidentEntity field . The next 12 octets are user - or application-specified . ,231,1045,field
1000030,Domain,Domain The 13-bit identifier specifying the naming and administration domain for the client and server named in the packet . ,230,1045,field
1000031,Length,Length A 13-bit field that specifies the number of 32-bit words in the segment data portion of the packet ( if any )  excluding the checksum field .

1000036,RES,RES Reserved for future use . Must be 0 . ,500,1045,field
1000037,MsgDelivery,MsgDelivery : 32 bits The segment blocks being transmitted ( in total ) in this packet group following the conventions for the PacketDelivery field . This field is ignored by the protocol and treated as an additional user data field if MDM is 0 . On transmission   the user level sets the MsgDelivery to indicate those portions of the segment to be transmitted . On receipt   the MsgDelivery field is modified by the VMTP module to indicate the segment data blocks that were actually received before the message control block is passed to the user or RPC level . In particular   the kernel does not discard the packet group if segment data blocks are missing . A Server or Client entity receiving a message with a MsgDelivery in use must check the field to ensure adequate delivery and retry the operation if necessary . ,400,1045,field
1000038,SegmentSize,SegmentSize : 32 bits Size of segment in octets   up to a maximum of 16 kilooctets without streaming and 4 megaoctets with streaming   if SDA is set . Otherwise   this field is ignored by the protocol and treated as an additional user data field . ,200,1045,field

1000408,Token Bucket Rate,The token bucket rate is one of three fields used to define how traffic will be injected into the internetwork by the sending application . ( The other two fields are the token bucket size and the maximum transmission rate .) ,231,1363,field
1000409,Token Bucket Size,The token bucket size controls the maximum amount of data that the flow can send at the peak rate . More formally   if the token bucket size is B   and the token bucket rate is R   over any arbitrarily chosen interval T in the life of the flow   the amount of data that the flow sends cannot have exceeded B + ( R * T ) bytes . ,400,1363,field
1000410,Maximum Transmission Rate,The maximum transmission rate limits how fast packets may be sent back to back from the host . Consider that if the token bucket is full   it is possible for the flow to send a series of back-to-back packets equal to the size of the token bucket . If the token bucket size is large   this back-to-back run may be long enough to significantly inhibit multiplexing . ,400,1363,field
1000411,Minimum Delay Noticed,The minimum delay noticed field tells the internetwork that the host and application are effectively insensitive to improvements in end-to-end delay below this value . The network is encouraged to drive the delay down to this value but need not try to improve the delay further . ,302,1363,field

1000413,Maximum Delay Variation,If a receiving application requires data to be delivered in the same pattern that the data was transmitted   it may be necessary for the receiving host to briefly buffer data as it is received so that the receiver can restore the old transmission pattern . ( An easy example of this is a case where an application wishes to send and transmit data such as voice samples   which are generated and played at regular intervals . The regular intervals may be distorted by queueing effects in the network and the receiver may ,400,1363,field
1000414,Loss Sensitivity,This field indicates how sensitive the flow's traffic is to losses . Loss sensitivity can be expressed in one of two ways : either as a number of losses of MTU-sized packets in an interval   or simply as a value indicating a level of sensitivity . ,231,1363,field

1000428,W,W The Width bit   when set   requests a 64 bit connection through the switch . It is meaningless if Cable B is not installed at the Source . If W is set and either the Source or the requested Destination has no Cable B to the switch   the switch rejects the connection . Otherwise the switch connects both Cable A and Cable B if W is set   or Cable A only if W is clear . This feature is useful if both Source and Destination implementations can selectively disable or enable Cable B on each new connection . ,210,1374,field
1000429,D,D The Direction bit   when set   reverses the sense of the Source Address and Destination Address fields . In other words   D=1 means that the Source Address is in bits 0-11 and the Destination Address is in bits 12-23 . This bit was defined to give devices a simple way to route return messages . It is not useful for LAN operations . ,210,1374,field

This field is modified in internet header processing . The time is measured in units of 500 milliseconds   but since every module that processes a datagram MUST decrease the TTL by at least one even if it process the datagram in less than 500 millisecond   the TTL must be thought of only as an upper bound on the time a datagram may exist . The intention is to cause undeliverable datagrams to be discarded   and to bound the maximum CLNP datagram lifetime . [ Like IP   the colloquial usage of TTL in CLNP is as a coarse hop-count .] ,120,1561,field
1000562,.,Three flags are defined . These occupy bits 0   1   and 2 of the Flags/Type octet : ,240,1561,field
1000563,.,The type field distinguishes data CLNP packets from Error Reports from Echo packets . The following values of the type field apply : ,231,1561,field
1000564,.,Like the Total Length of the IP header   the Fragment length field contains the length in octets of the fragment ( i.e .  this datagram ) including both header and data . ,100,1561,field
1000565,.,A checksum is computed on the header only . It MUST be verified at each host/router that processes the packet; if header fields are changed during processing ( e.g .  the Lifetime )  the checksum is modified . If the checksum is not used   this field MUST be coded with a value of zero ( 0 ). See Appendix A for algorithms used in the computation and adjustment of the checksum . Readers are encouraged to see [ 10 ] for a description of an efficient implementation of the checksum algorithm . ,301,1561,field
1000566,.,CLNP uses OSI network service access point addresses ( NSAPAs ); NSAPAs serve the same identification and location functions as an IP address   plus the protocol selector value encoded in the IPv4 datagram header   and with additional hierarchy . General purpose ,231,1561,field
1000567,.,Like the Identification field of IP   this 16-bit field is used to distinguish segments of the same ( original ) packet for the purposes of reassembly . This field is present when the fragmentation permitted flag is set to one . ,400,1561,field
1000568,.,Like the Fragment Offset of IP   this 16-bit is used to identify the relative octet position of the data in this fragment with respect to the start of the data submitted to CLNP; i.e .  it indicates where in the original datagram this fragment belongs . The offset is measured in octets; the value of this field shall always be a multiple of eight ( 8 ). This field is present when the fragmentation permitted flag is set to one . ,110,1561,field
1000569,.,The total length of the CLNP packet in octets is determined by the originator and placed in the Total Length field of the header . The Total Length field specifies the entire length of the original datagram   including both the header and data . This field MUST NOT be changed in any fragment of the original packet for the duration of the packet lifetime . This field is present when the fragmentation permitted flag is set to one . ,100,1561,field
1000570,.,All CLNP options are " triplets " of the form < parameter code >  < parameter length >  and < parameter value >. Both the parameter code and length fields are always one octet long; the length parameter value   in octets   is indicated in the parameter length field .

1000912,SSRC,Synchronization source ( SSRC ): The source of a stream of RTP packets   identified by a 32-bit numeric SSRC identifier carried in the RTP header so as not to be dependent upon the network address . All packets from a synchronization source form part of the same timing and sequence number space   so a receiver groups packets by synchronization source for playback . Examples of synchronization sources include the sender of a stream of packets derived from a signal source such as a microphone or a camera   or an RTP mixer ( see below ). A synchronization source may change its data format   e.g .  audio encoding   over time . The SSRC identifier is a randomly chosen value meant to be globally unique within a particular RTP session ( see Section 8 ). A participant need not use the same SSRC identifier for all the RTP sessions in a multimedia session; the binding of the SSRC identifiers is provided through RTCP ( see Section 6.4.1 ). If a participant generates multiple streams in one RTP session   for example from separate video cameras   each must be identified as a different SSRC . ,230,1889,field
1000913,CSRC,Contributing source ( CSRC ): A source of a stream of RTP packets that has contributed to the combined stream produced by an RTP mixer ( see below ). The mixer inserts a list of the SSRC identifiers of the sources that contributed to the generation of a particular packet into the RTP header of that packet . This list is called the CSRC list . An example application is audio conferencing where a mixer indicates all the talkers whose speech was combined to produce the outgoing packet   allowing the receiver to indicate the current talker   even though all the audio packets contain the same SSRC identifier ( that of the mixer ). ,230,1889,field
1000914,V,version ( V ): 2 bits This field identifies the version of RTP . The version defined by this specification is two ( 2 ). ( The value 1 is used by the first draft version of RTP and the value 0 is used by the protocol initially implemented in the " vat " audio tool .) ,220,1889,field
1000915,P,padding ( P ): 1 bit If the padding bit is set   the packet contains one or more additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the ,231,1889,field
1000916,X,extension ( X ): 1 bit If the extension bit is set   the fixed header is followed by exactly one header extension   with a format defined in Section 5.3.1 . ,210,1889,field
1000917,CC,CSRC count ( CC ): 4 bits The CSRC count contains the number of CSRC identifiers that follow the fixed header . ,231,1889,field
1000918,M,marker ( M ): 1 bit The interpretation of the marker is defined by a profile . It is intended to allow significant events such as frame boundaries to be marked in the packet stream . A profile may define additional marker bits or specify that there is no marker bit by changing the number of bits in the payload type field ( see Section 5.3 ). ,210,1889,field
1000919,PT,payload type ( PT ): 7 bits This field identifies the format of the RTP payload and determines its interpretation by the application . A profile specifies a default static mapping of payload type codes to payload formats . Additional payload type codes may be defined dynamically through non-RTP means ( see Section 3 ). An initial set of default mappings for audio and video is specified in the companion profile Internet-Draft draft-ietf-avt-profile   and may be extended in future editions of the Assigned Numbers RFC [ 6 ]. An RTP sender emits a single RTP payload type at any given time; this field is not intended for multiplexing separate media streams ( see Section 5.2 ). ,231,1889,field
1000920,sequence number,sequence number : 16 bits The sequence number increments by one for each RTP data packet sent   and may be used by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence . The initial value of the sequence number is random ( unpredictable ) to make known-plaintext attacks on encryption more difficult   even if the source itself does not encrypt   because the packets may flow through a translator that does . Techniques for choosing unpredictable numbers are discussed in [ 7 ]. ,200,1889,field
1000921,timestamp,timestamp : 32 bits The timestamp reflects the sampling instant of the first octet in the RTP data packet . The sampling instant must be derived ,121,1889,field
1000922,SSRC,SSRC : 32 bits The SSRC field identifies the synchronization source . This identifier is chosen randomly   with the intent that no two synchronization sources within the same RTP session will have the same SSRC identifier . An example algorithm for generating a random identifier is presented in Appendix A.6 . Although the probability of multiple sources choosing the same identifier is low   all RTP implementations must be prepared to detect and resolve collisions . Section 8 describes the probability of collision along with a mechanism for resolving collisions and detecting RTP-level forwarding loops based on the uniqueness of the SSRC identifier . If a source changes its source transport address   it must also choose a new SSRC identifier to avoid being interpreted as a looped source . ,230,1889,field
1000923,V,version ( V ): 2 bits Identifies the version of RTP   which is the same in RTCP packets as in RTP data packets . The version defined by this specification is two ( 2 ). ,220,1889,field
1000924,P,padding ( P ): 1 bit If the padding bit is set   this RTCP packet contains some additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the control information . The last octet of the padding is a count of how many padding octets should be ignored . Padding may be needed by some encryption algorithms with fixed block sizes . In a compound RTCP packet   padding should only be required on the last individual packet because the compound packet is encrypted as a whole . ,231,1889,field
1000925,RC,reception report count ( RC ): 5 bits The number of reception report blocks contained in this packet . A value of zero is valid . ,200,1889,field

1000927,length,length : 16 bits The length of this RTCP packet in 32-bit words minus one   including the header and any padding . ( The offset of one makes zero a valid length and avoids a possible infinite loop in scanning a compound RTCP packet   while counting 32-bit words avoids a validity check for a multiple of 4 .) ,100,1889,field
1000928,SSRC,SSRC : 32 bits The synchronization source identifier for the originator of this SR packet . ,230,1889,field
1000929,RTP timestamp,RTP timestamp : 32 bits Corresponds to the same time as the NTP timestamp ( above )  but in the same units and with the same random offset as the RTP timestamps in data packets . This correspondence may be used for intra - and inter-media synchronization for sources whose NTP timestamps are synchronized   and may be used by media - independent receivers to estimate the nominal RTP clock frequency . Note that in most cases this timestamp will not be equal to the RTP timestamp in any adjacent data packet . Rather   it is calculated from the corresponding NTP timestamp using the relationship between the RTP timestamp counter and real time as maintained by periodically checking the wallclock time at a sampling instant . ,122,1889,field
1000930,sender's packet count,sender's packet count : 32 bits The total number of RTP data packets transmitted by the sender since starting transmission up until the time this SR packet was generated . The count is reset if the sender changes its SSRC identifier . ,200,1889,field
1000931,sender's octet count,sender's octet count : 32 bits The total number of payload octets ( i.e .  not including header or padding ) transmitted in RTP data packets by the sender since starting transmission up until the time this SR packet was generated . The count is reset if the sender changes its SSRC identifier . This field can be used to estimate the average payload data rate . ,100,1889,field
1000932,fraction lost,fraction lost : 8 bits The fraction of RTP data packets from source SSRC_n lost since the previous SR or RR packet was sent   expressed as a fixed ,302,1889,field
1000933,cumulative number of packets lost,cumulative number of packets lost : 24 bits The total number of RTP data packets from source SSRC_n that have been lost since the beginning of reception . This number is defined to be the number of packets expected less the number of packets actually received   where the number of packets received includes any which are late or duplicates . Thus packets that arrive late are not counted as lost   and the loss may be negative if there are duplicates . The number of packets expected is defined to be the extended last sequence number received   as defined next   less the initial sequence number received . This may be calculated as shown in Appendix A.3 . ,200,1889,field
1000934,extended highest sequence number received,extended highest sequence number received : 32 bits The low 16 bits contain the highest sequence number received in an RTP data packet from source SSRC_n   and the most significant 16 bits extend that sequence number with the corresponding count of sequence number cycles   which may be maintained according to the algorithm in Appendix A.1 . Note that different receivers within the same session will generate different extensions to the sequence number if their start times differ significantly . ,200,1889,field
1000935,interarrival jitter,interarrival jitter : 32 bits An estimate of the statistical variance of the RTP data packet interarrival time   measured in timestamp units and expressed as an unsigned integer . The interarrival jitter J is defined to be the mean deviation ( smoothed absolute value ) of the difference D in packet spacing at the receiver compared to the sender for a pair of packets . As shown in the equation below   this is equivalent to the difference in the " relative transit time " for the two packets; the relative transit time is the difference between a packet's RTP timestamp and the receiver's clock at the time of arrival   measured in the same units . ,122,1889,field

The application creator might choose to use the application name   and then coordinate the allocation of subtype values to others who want to define new packet types for the application . Alternatively   it is recommended that others choose a name based on the entity they represent   then coordinate the use of the name within that entity . The name is interpreted as a sequence of four ASCII characters   with uppercase and lowercase characters treated as distinct . ,231,1889,field

1000963,Hop Count,The Hop Count field carries the maximum number of routers an SDRP data packet may traverse . It is decremented by 1 as an SDRP data packet traverses a router which forwards the packet using SDRP forwarding . Once the Hop Count field reaches the value of 0   the router should discard the data packet and generate a control packet ( see Section 5.2.6 ).

1001745,LS age,This field is the age of the LSA in seconds . It should be processed as an unsigned 16-bit integer . It is set to 0 when the LSA is originated . It must be incremented by InfTransDelay on every hop of the flooding procedure . LSAs are also aged as they are held in each router's database . ,121,2178,field
1001746,Options,The Options field in the LSA header indicates which optional capabilities are associated with the LSA . OSPF's optional capabilities are described in Section 4.5 . One optional capability is defined by this specification   represented by the E-bit found in the Options field . The unrecognized bits in the Options field should be set to zero . The E-bit represents OSPF's ExternalRoutingCapability . This bit should be set in all LSAs associated with the backbone   and all LSAs associated with non-stub areas ( see Section 3.6 ). It should also be set in all AS-external-LSAs . It should be reset in all router-LSAs   network-LSAs and summary-LSAs associated with a stub area . For all LSAs   the setting of the E-bit is for informational purposes only; it does not affect the routing table calculation . ,231,2178,field
1001747,LS type,The LS type field dictates the format and function of the LSA . LSAs of different types have different names ( e.g .  router-LSAs or network-LSAs ). All LSA types defined by this memo   except the AS - external-LSAs ( LS type = 5 )  are flooded throughout a single area only . AS-external-LSAs are flooded throughout the entire Autonomous System   excepting stub areas ( see Section 3.6 ). Each separate LSA type is briefly described below in Table 15 . ,231,2178,field
1001748,Link State ID,This field identifies the piece of the routing domain that is being described by the LSA . Depending on the LSA's LS type   the Link State ID takes on the values listed in Table 16 . ,230,2178,field
1001749,Advertising Router,This field specifies the OSPF Router ID of the LSA's originator . For router-LSAs   this field is identical to the Link State ID field . Network-LSAs are originated by the network's Designated Router . Summary-LSAs originated by area border routers . AS-external-LSAs are originated by AS boundary routers . ,230,2178,field
1001750,LS sequence number,The sequence number field is a signed 32-bit integer . It is used to detect old and duplicate LSAs . The space of sequence numbers is linearly ordered . The larger the sequence number ( when compared as signed 32-bit integers ) the more recent the LSA . To describe to sequence number space more precisely   let N refer in the discussion below to the constant 2**31 . ,200,2178,field
1001751,LS checksum,This field is the checksum of the complete contents of the LSA   excepting the LS age field . The LS age field is excepted so that an LSA's age can be incremented without updating the checksum . The checksum used is the same that is used for ISO connectionless datagrams; it is commonly referred to as the Fletcher checksum . It is documented in Annex B of [ Ref6 ]. The LSA header also contains the length of the LSA in bytes; subtracting the size of the LS age field ( two bytes ) yields the amount of data to checksum . ,400,2178,field

1001753,5,The stub networks are added to the tree in the procedure's second stage . In this stage   all router vertices are again examined . Those that have been determined to be unreachable in the above first phase are discarded . For each reachable router vertex ( call it V )  the associated router-LSA is found in the link state database . Each stub network link appearing in the LSA is then examined   and the following steps are executed : ,400,2178,field

1001758,1,( 2 ) The checksum field in the standard OSPF header is set to the standard IP checksum of the entire contents of the packet   starting with the OSPF packet header but excluding the 64-bit authentication field . This checksum is calculated as the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of all the 16-bit words in the packet   excepting the authentication field . If the packet's length is not an integral number of 16-bit words   the packet is padded with a byte of zero before checksumming . ,301,2178,field

Set to 1 when the information contained in the previously transmitted Picture Headers can't be used to reconstruct a header for the current picture . This happens when the current picture is encoded using a different set of parameters than the previous pictures of the same type . The N bit must be constant for all RTP packets that belong to the same picture so that receipt of any packet from a picture allows detecting whether information necessary for reconstruction was contained in that picture ( N = 1 ) or a previous one ( N = 0 ). ,210,2250,field

1001832,h.sessionID,The session ID uniquely identifies a session over which AgentX PDUs are exchanged between a subagent and the master agent . The session ID has no significance and no defined value in the agentx-Open-PDU sent by a subagent to open a session with the master agent; in this case   the master agent will assign a unique sessionID that it will pass back in the corresponding agentx-Response-PDU . From that point on   that same sessionID will appear in every AgentX PDU exchanged over that session between the master and the subagent . A subagent may establish multiple AgentX sessions by sending multiple agentx-Open-PDUs to the master agent . ,230,2257,field
1001833,h.transactionID,The transaction ID uniquely identifies   for a given session   the single SNMP management request ( and single SNMP PDU ) with which an AgentX PDU is associated . If a single SNMP management request results in multiple AgentX PDUs being sent by the master agent with the same sessionID   each of these AgentX PDUs must contain the same transaction ID; conversely   AgentX PDUs sent during a particular session   that result from distinct SNMP management requests   must have distinct transaction IDs within the limits of the 32-bit field ). ,230,2257,field
1001834,h.packetID,A packet ID generated by the sender for all AgentX PDUs except the agentx-Response-PDU . In an agentx-Response-PDU   the packet ID must be the same as that in the received AgentX PDU to which it is a response . A master agent might use this field to associate subagent response PDUs with their corresponding request PDUs . A subagent might use this field to correlate responses to multiple ( batched ) registrations . ,230,2257,field
1001835,h.payload_length,The size in octets of the PDU contents   excluding the 20-byte header . As a result of the encoding schemes and PDU layouts   this value will always be either 0   or a multiple of 4 . ,100,2257,field
1001836,c.reason,An enumerated value that gives the reason that the master agent or subagent closed the AgentX session . This field may take one of the following values : ,230,2257,field
1001837,r.timeout,The length of time   in seconds   that a master agent should allow to elapse after dispatching a message to a subagent before it regards the subagent as not responding . r.timeout applies only to messages that concern MIB objects within r.region . It overrides both the subagent-wide value ( if any ) indicated when the AgentX session with the master agent was established   and the master agent's default timeout . The default value for r.timeout is 0 ( no override ). ,120,2257,field
1001838,r.priority,A value between 1 and 255   used to achieve a desired configuration when different subagents register identical or overlapping regions . Subagents with no particular knowledge of priority should register with the default value of 255 ( lowest priority ). ,110,2257,field
1001839,r.range_subid,Permits specifying a range in place of one of r.region's sub - identifiers . If this value is 0   no range is specified . Otherwise the " r.range_subid"-th sub-identifier in r.region is a range lower bound   and the range upper bound sub-identifier ( r.upper_bound ) immediately follows r.region . ,231,2257,field
1001840,u.priority,The priority at which this region was originally registered . ,230,2257,field
1001841,h.sessionID,If this is a response to a agentx-Open-PDU   then it contains the new and unique sessionID ( as assigned by the master agent ) for this session . ,400,2257,field
1001842,h.transactionID,Must be identical to the h.transactionID value in the PDU to which this PDU is a response . ,231,2257,field

1001845,res.error,Indicates error status ( including ` noError '). Values are limited to those defined for errors in the SNMPv2 SMI ( RFC 1905 [ 4 ])  and the following AgentX-specific values : ,231,2257,field
1001846,res.index,In error cases   this is the index of the failed variable binding within a received request PDU . ( Note : As explained in section 5.4   Value Representation   the index values of variable bindings within a variable binding list are 1-based .) ,231,2257,field
1001847,4,If r.region ( or any of its set of Object Identifiers   if r.range is non-zero ) is exactly the same as any currently registered value of r.region ( or any of its set of Object Identifiers )  this registration is termed a duplicate region . ,230,2257,field
1001848,1,Because AgentX supports overlapping registrations   it is possible for the master agent to obtain a value for a requested varbind from within multiple registered MIB regions . ,303,2257,field
1001849,2,The master agent may choose to send agentx-Get-PDUs while servicing an SNMP GetNextRequest-PDU . The master agent may choose to send agentx-Get-PDUs or agentx-GetNext-PDUs while servicing an SNMP GetBulkRequest-PDU . One possible reason for this would be if the current iteration has targeted instance-level registrations . ,231,2257,field
1001850,3,For Get/GetNext/GetBulk operations   at any stage of the possibly iterative process   the master agent may need to dispatch several SearchRanges to a particular subagent session . The master agent may send one   some   or all of the SearchRanges in a single AgentX PDU . ,303,2257,field
1001851,4,The master agent chooses a timeout value for each MIB region being queried   which is ,110,2257,field
1001852,5,If the master agent has determined that a specific non-default context is associated with the SNMP request PDU   that context is encoded into the AgentX PDU's context field and the NON_DEFAULT_CONTEXT bit is set in h.flags . ,400,2257,field

1001899,B,B : Bidirectional The Bidirectional flag applies only to the Add Branch message . In all other Connection Management messages it is not used . It may only be used when establishing a point - to-point connection . The Bidirectional flag in an Add Branch message   if set   requests that two unidirectional virtual channels or virtual paths be established   one in the forward direction   and one in the reverse direction .

The forward direction uses the values of Input Port   Input VPI   Input VCI   Output Port   Output VPI   and Output VCI as specified in the Add Branch message . The reverse direction is derived by exchanging the values specified in the Input Port   Input VPI   and Input VCI fields   with those of the Output Port   Output VPI   and Output VCI fields respectively . Thus   a virtual connection in the reverse direction arrives at the input port specified by the Output Port field   on the VPI/VCI specified by the Output VPI and Output VCI fields .

1002084,P,P : 1 bit Indicates the picture start or a picture segment ( GOB/Slice ) start or a video sequence end ( EOS or EOSBS ). Two bytes of zero bits then have to be prefixed to the payload of such a packet to compose a complete picture/GOB/slice/EOS/EOSBS start code . This bit allows the omission of the two first bytes of the start codes   thus improving the compression ratio . ,210,2429,field
1002085,V,V : 1 bit Indicates the presence of an 8 bit field containing information for Video Redundancy Coding ( VRC )  which follows immediately after the initial 16 bits of the payload header if present . For syntax and semantics of that 8 bit VRC field see section 4.2 . ,210,2429,field
1002086,PLEN,PLEN : 6 bits Length in bytes of the extra picture header . If no extra picture header is attached   PLEN is 0 . If PLEN>0   the extra picture header is attached immediately following the rest of the payload header . Note the length reflects the omission of the first two bytes of the picture start code ( PSC ). See section 5.1 . ,100,2429,field
1002087,PEBIT,PEBIT : 3 bits Indicates the number of bits that shall be ignored in the last byte of the picture header . If PLEN is not zero   the ignored bits shall be the least significant bits of the byte . If PLEN is zero   then PEBIT shall also be zero . ,303,2429,field
1002088,TID,TID : 3 bits Thread ID . Up to 7 threads are allowed . Each frame of H.263 + VRC data will use as reference information only sync frames or frames within the same thread . By convention   thread 0 is expected to be the " canonical " thread   which is the thread from which the sync frame should ideally be used . In the case of corruption or loss of the thread 0 representation   a representation of the sync frame with a higher thread number can be used by the decoder . Lower thread numbers are expected to contain equal or better representations of the sync frames than higher thread numbers in the absence of data corruption or loss . See [ 7 ] for a detailed discussion of VRC . ,201,2429,field
1002089,Trun,Trun : 4 bits Monotonically increasing ( modulo 16 ) 4 bit number counting the packet number within each thread . ,100,2429,field
1002090,S,S : 1 bit A bit that indicates that the packet content is for a sync frame . An encoder using VRC may send several representations of the same " sync " picture   in order to ensure that regardless of which thread of pictures is corrupted by errors or packet losses   the reception of at least one representation of a particular picture is ensured ( within at least one thread ). The sync picture can then be used for the prediction of any thread . If packet losses have not occurred   then the sync frame contents of thread 0 can be used and those of other threads can be discarded ( and similarly for other threads ). Thread 0 is considered the " canonical " thread   the use of which is preferable to all others . The contents of packets having lower thread numbers shall be considered as having a higher processing and delivery priority than those with higher thread numbers . Thus packets having lower thread numbers for a given sync frame shall be delivered first to the decoder under loss-free and ,210,2429,field

Any other scan line is considered a component of the second field   and the F bit will be set to 1 . This bit is copied directly from the BT.656-compliant stream by the transmitter   and inserted into the stream by the receiver . ,210,2431,field
1002092,V,V : 1 bit When 1   indicates that the scan line is part of the vertical interval . Should always be 0 unless frame blanking data is sent . In which case   the V bit SHOULD be set to 1 for scan lines which do not form an integral part of the image . This bit is copied directly from the BT.656-compliant stream by the transmitter   and inserted into the stream by the receiver . For receivers which do not receive scan lines during the vertical interval   BT.656 vertical interval data MUST be generated by repeating the quad-sample sequence 0x80   0x10   0x80   0x10   representing a true black level . ,210,2431,field

1002099,Type,The type field specifies the information that would otherwise be present in a JPEG abbreviated table-specification as well as the additional JFIF-style parameters not defined by JPEG . Types 0-63 are reserved as fixed   well-known mappings to be defined by this document and future revisions of this document . Types 64-127 are the same as types 0-63   except that restart markers are present in the JPEG data and a Restart Marker header appears immediately following the main JPEG header . Types 128-255 are free to be dynamically defined by a session setup protocol ( which is beyond the scope of this document ). ,231,2435,field
1002100,Q,The Q field defines the quantization tables for this frame . Q values 0-127 indicate the quantization tables are computed using an algorithm determined by the Type field ( see below ). Q values 128-255 indicate that a Quantization Table header appears after the main JPEG header ( and the Restart Marker header   if present ) in the first packet of the frame ( fragment offset 0 ). This header can be used to explicitly specify the quantization tables in-band . ,210,2435,field

1002102,Height,This field encodes the height of the image in 8-pixel multiples ( e.g .  a height of 30 denotes an image 240 pixels tall ). When encoding interlaced video   this is the height of a video field   since fields are individually JPEG encoded . The maximum height is 2040 pixels . ,100,2435,field

The session ID has no significance and no defined value in the agentx-Open-PDU sent by a subagent to open a session with the master agent; in this case   the master agent will assign a unique session ID that it will pass back in the corresponding agentx-Response-PDU . From that point on   that same session ID will appear in every AgentX PDU exchanged over that session between the master and the subagent . A subagent may establish multiple AgentX sessions by sending multiple agentx-Open-PDUs to the master agent . ,230,2741,field
1002662,h.transactionID,The transaction ID uniquely identifies   for a given session   the single SNMP management request ( and single SNMP PDU ) with which an AgentX PDU is associated . If a single SNMP management request results in multiple AgentX PDUs being sent by the master agent with the same session ID   each of these AgentX PDUs must contain the same transaction ID; conversely   AgentX PDUs sent during a particular session   that result from distinct SNMP management requests   must have distinct transaction IDs within the limits of the 32 - bit field ). ,230,2741,field
1002663,h.packetID,A packet ID generated by the sender for all AgentX PDUs except the agentx-Response-PDU . In an agentx-Response-PDU   the packet ID must be the same as that in the received AgentX PDU to which it is a response . A master agent might ,230,2741,field
1002664,h.payload_length,The size in octets of the PDU contents   excluding the 20 - byte header . As a result of the encoding schemes and PDU layouts   this value will always be either 0   or a multiple of 4 . ,100,2741,field
1002665,c.reason,An enumerated value that gives the reason that the master agent or subagent closed the AgentX session . This field may take one of the following values : ,230,2741,field
1002666,r.timeout,The length of time   in seconds   that a master agent should allow to elapse after dispatching a message on a session before it regards the subagent as not responding . r.timeout applies only to messages that concern MIB objects within r.subtree . It overrides both the session's default value ( if any ) indicated when the AgentX session with the master agent was established   and the master agent's default timeout . The default value for r.timeout is 0 ( no override ). ,120,2741,field
1002667,r.priority,A value between 1 and 255   used to achieve a desired configuration when different sessions register identical or overlapping regions . Subagents with no particular knowledge of priority should register with the default value of 127 . ,201,2741,field
1002668,r.range_subid,Permits specifying a range in place of one of r.subtree's sub-identifiers . If this value is 0   no range is being specified and there is no r.upper_bound field present in the PDU . In this case the MIB region being registered is the single subtree named by r.subtree . ,400,2741,field
1002669,u.priority,The priority at which this region was originally registered . ,230,2741,field
1002670,u.range_subid,Indicates a sub-identifier in u.subtree is a range lower bound . ,231,2741,field

1002672,g.max_repetitions,The maximum number of repetitions requested for repeating variables . ,400,2741,field
1002673,h.sessionID,If this is a response to an agentx-Open-PDU   then it contains the new and unique sessionID ( as assigned by the master agent ) for this session . ,400,2741,field
1002674,h.transactionID,Must be identical to the h.transactionID value in the PDU to which this PDU is a response . ,231,2741,field
1002675,h.packetID,Must be identical to the h.packetID value in the PDU to which this PDU is a response . ,231,2741,field
1002676,res.sysUpTime,This field contains the current value of sysUpTime for the context indicated within the PDU to which this PDU is a response . It is relevant only in agentx response PDUs sent from the master agent to a subagent in response to the set of administrative PDUs listed in section 6.1   " AgentX PDU Header ". ,400,2741,field
1002677,res.error,Indicates error status . Within responses to the set of " administrative " PDU types listed in section 6.1   " AgentX PDU Header "  values are limited to the following : ,240,2741,field
1002678,res.index,In error cases   this is the index of the failed variable binding within a received request PDU . ( Note : As explained in section 5.4   " Value Representation "  the index values of variable bindings within a variable binding list are 1 - based .) ,231,2741,field

1002682,2,( a ) if the first VarBind is not snmpTrapOID.0   res.error is set to ` processingError ' and res.index to 1 ,210,2741,field
1002683,1,If a subagent does not receive a response to its pings   or if it is able to detect ( from the underlying transport ) that the master agent is not able to receive AgentX messages   then it eventually must initiate a new AgentX session   re-register its MIB regions   etc . ,201,2741,field
1002684,1,Because AgentX supports registration of duplicate and overlapping regions   it is possible for the master agent to obtain a value for a requested varbind from within multiple registered MIB regions . ,400,2741,field
1002685,2,The master agent may choose to send agentx-Get-PDUs while servicing an SNMP GetNextRequest-PDU . The master agent may choose to send agentx-Get-PDUs or agentx-GetNext-PDUs while servicing an SNMP GetBulkRequest-PDU . One possible reason for this would be if the current iteration has targeted instance-level registrations . ,231,2741,field
1002686,3,For Get/GetNext/GetBulk operations   at any stage of the possibly iterative process   the master agent may need to dispatch several SearchRanges to a particular subagent session . The master agent may send one   some   or all of the SearchRanges in a single AgentX PDU . ,303,2741,field
1002687,4,The master agent chooses a timeout value for each MIB region being queried   which is ,110,2741,field

1002728,volume,volume : For DTMF digits and other events representable as tones   this field describes the power level of the tone   expressed in dBm0 after dropping the sign . Power levels range from 0 to - 63 dBm0 . The range of valid DTMF is from 0 to - 36 dBm0 ( must accept); lower than - 55 dBm0 must be rejected ( TR-TSY-000181   ITU-T Q.24A ). Thus   larger values denote lower volume . This value is defined only for DTMF digits . For other events   it is set to zero by the sender and is ignored by the receiver . ,231,2833,field
1002729,duration,duration : Duration of this digit   in timestamp units . Thus   the event began at the instant identified by the RTP timestamp and has so far lasted as long as indicated by this parameter . The event may or may not have ended . ,121,2833,field
1002730,E,E : If set to a value of one   the " end " bit indicates that this packet contains the end of the event . Thus   the duration parameter above measures the complete duration of the event . ,210,2833,field

The minimum length is 20 and maximum length is 4096 . ,100,2865,field
1002746,Authenticator,The Authenticator field is sixteen ( 16 ) octets . The most significant octet is transmitted first . This value is used to authenticate the reply from the RADIUS server   and is used in the password hiding algorithm . ,301,2865,field
1002747,Request Authenticator,In Access-Request Packets   the Authenticator value is a 16 octet random number   called the Request Authenticator . The value SHOULD be unpredictable and unique over the lifetime of a secret ( the password shared between the client and the RADIUS server )  since repetition of a request value in conjunction with the same secret would permit an attacker to reply with a previously intercepted response . Since it is expected that the same secret MAY be used to authenticate with servers in disparate geographic regions   the Request Authenticator field SHOULD exhibit global and temporal uniqueness . ,230,2865,field
1002748,Response Authenticator,The value of the Authenticator field in Access-Accept   Access - Reject   and Access-Challenge packets is called the Response Authenticator   and contains a one-way MD5 hash calculated over a stream of octets consisting of : the RADIUS packet   beginning with the Code field   including the Identifier   the Length   the Request Authenticator field from the Access-Request packet   and the response Attributes   followed by the shared secret .

1003015,PRI,This three bit field indicates the priority level of the SRP packet ( 0 through 7 ). The higher the value the higher the priority . Since there are only two queues in the transit buffer ( HPTB and LPTB ) a packet is treated as either low or high priority once it is on the ring . Each node determines the threshold value for determining what is considered a high priority packet and what is considered a low priority packet . However   the full 8 levels of priority in the SRP header can be used prior to transmission onto the ring ( transmit queues ) as well as after reception from the ring ( receive queues ). ,231,2892,field

1003189,Intra-domain,Much of the initial work on accounting management has focused on intra-domain accounting applications . However   with the increasing deployment of services such as dial-up roaming   Internet fax   Voice and Video over IP and QoS   applications requiring inter-domain accounting are becoming increasingly common . ,400,2975,field
1003190,Packet loss,As packet loss is a fact of life on the Internet   accounting protocols dealing with session data need to be resilient against packet loss . This is particularly important in inter-domain accounting   where packets often pass through Network Access Points ,400,2975,field
1003191,Device reboots,In the event of a device reboot   it is desirable to minimize the loss of data on sessions in progress . Such losses may be significant even if the devices themselves are very reliable   due to long-lived sessions   which can comprise a significant fraction of total resource consumption . To guard against loss of these high-value sessions   interim accounting data is typically transmitted over the wire . When interim accounting in-place is combined with non-volatile storage it becomes possible to guard against data loss in much shorter sessions . This is possible since interim accounting data need only be stored in non-volatile memory until the session completes   at which time the interim data may be replaced by the session record . As a result   interim accounting data need never be sent over the wire   and it is possible to decrease the interim interval so as to provide a very high degree of protection against data loss . ,302,2975,field
1003192,Memory,In accounting systems without non-volatile storage   accounting data must be stored in volatile memory during the period between when it is generated and when it is transferred . The resulting memory consumption will depend on retry and retransmission algorithms . Since systems designed for high reliability will typically wish to retry for long periods   or may store interim accounting data   the resulting memory consumption can be considerable . As a result   if non-volatile storage is unavailable   it may be desirable to compress accounting data awaiting transmission . ,120,2975,field
1003193,CPU requirements,CPU consumption of the managed and managing nodes will be proportional to the complexity of the required accounting processing . Operations such as ASN.1 encoding and decoding   compression/decompression   and encryption/decryption can consume considerable resources   both on accounting clients and servers . ,400,2975,field

1003523,B,B : Bi-directional The Bi-directional flag applies only to the Add Branch message . In all other Connection Management messages it is not used . It may only be used when establishing a point-to-point connection . The Bi-directional flag in an Add Branch message   if set   requests that two unidirectional connections be established   one in the forward direction   and one in the reverse direction . It is equivalent to two Add Branch messages   one specifying the forward direction   and one specifying the reverse direction . The forward direction uses the values of Input Port   Input Label   Output Port and Output Label as specified in the Add Branch message . The reverse direction is derived by exchanging the values specified in the Input Port and Input Label fields   with those of the Output Port and Output Label fields respectively . Thus   a connection in the reverse direction originates at the input port specified by the Output Port field   on the label specified by the Output Label field . It departs from the output port specified by the Input Port field   on the label specified by the Input Label field . ,231,3292,field

1004081,SSRC,Synchronization source ( SSRC ): The source of a stream of RTP packets   identified by a 32-bit numeric SSRC identifier carried in the RTP header so as not to be dependent upon the network address . All packets from a synchronization source form part of the same timing and sequence number space   so a receiver groups packets by synchronization source for playback . Examples of synchronization sources include the sender of a stream of packets derived from a signal source such as a microphone or a camera   or an RTP mixer ( see below ). A synchronization source may change its data format   e.g .  audio encoding   over time . The SSRC identifier is a randomly chosen value meant to be globally unique within a particular RTP session ( see Section 8 ). A participant need not use the same SSRC identifier for all the RTP sessions in a multimedia session; the binding of the SSRC identifiers is provided through RTCP ( see Section 6.5.1 ). If a participant generates multiple streams in one RTP session   for example from separate video cameras   each MUST be identified as a different SSRC . ,230,3550,field
1004082,CSRC,Contributing source ( CSRC ): A source of a stream of RTP packets that has contributed to the combined stream produced by an RTP mixer ( see below ). The mixer inserts a list of the SSRC identifiers of the sources that contributed to the generation of a particular packet into the RTP header of that packet . This list is called the CSRC list . An example application is audio conferencing where a mixer indicates all the talkers whose speech ,230,3550,field
1004083,V,version ( V ): 2 bits This field identifies the version of RTP . The version defined by this specification is two ( 2 ). ( The value 1 is used by the first draft version of RTP and the value 0 is used by the protocol initially implemented in the " vat " audio tool .) ,220,3550,field
1004084,P,padding ( P ): 1 bit If the padding bit is set   the packet contains one or more additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the payload . The last octet of the padding contains a count of how many padding octets should be ignored   including itself . Padding may be needed by some encryption algorithms with fixed block sizes or for carrying several RTP packets in a lower-layer protocol data unit . ,231,3550,field
1004085,X,extension ( X ): 1 bit If the extension bit is set   the fixed header MUST be followed by exactly one header extension   with a format defined in Section 5.3.1 . ,210,3550,field
1004086,CC,CSRC count ( CC ): 4 bits The CSRC count contains the number of CSRC identifiers that follow the fixed header . ,231,3550,field
1004087,M,marker ( M ): 1 bit The interpretation of the marker is defined by a profile . It is intended to allow significant events such as frame boundaries to be marked in the packet stream . A profile MAY define additional marker bits or specify that there is no marker bit by changing the number of bits in the payload type field ( see Section 5.3 ). ,210,3550,field
1004088,PT,payload type ( PT ): 7 bits This field identifies the format of the RTP payload and determines its interpretation by the application . A profile MAY specify a default static mapping of payload type codes to payload formats . Additional payload type codes MAY be defined dynamically through non-RTP means ( see Section 3 ). A set of default mappings for audio and video is specified in the companion RFC 3551 [ 1 ]. An RTP source MAY change the payload type during a session   but this field SHOULD NOT be used for multiplexing separate media streams ( see Section 5.2 ). ,231,3550,field
1004089,sequence number,sequence number : 16 bits The sequence number increments by one for each RTP data packet sent   and may be used by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence . The initial value of the sequence number SHOULD be random ( unpredictable ) to make known-plaintext attacks on encryption more difficult   even if the source itself does not encrypt according to the method in Section 9.1   because the packets may flow through a translator that does . Techniques for choosing unpredictable numbers are discussed in [ 17 ]. ,200,3550,field
1004090,timestamp,timestamp : 32 bits The timestamp reflects the sampling instant of the first octet in the RTP data packet . The sampling instant MUST be derived from a clock that increments monotonically and linearly in time to allow synchronization and jitter calculations ( see Section 6.4.1 ). The resolution of the clock MUST be sufficient for the desired synchronization accuracy and for measuring packet arrival jitter ( one tick per video frame is typically not sufficient ). The clock frequency is dependent on the format of data carried as payload and is specified statically in the profile or payload format specification that defines the format   or MAY be specified dynamically for payload formats defined through non-RTP means . If RTP packets are generated periodically   the nominal sampling instant as determined from the sampling clock is to be used   not a reading of the system clock . As an example   for fixed-rate audio the timestamp clock would likely increment by one for each sampling period . If an audio application reads blocks covering ,121,3550,field
1004091,SSRC,SSRC : 32 bits The SSRC field identifies the synchronization source . This identifier SHOULD be chosen randomly   with the intent that no two synchronization sources within the same RTP session will have the same SSRC identifier . An example algorithm for generating a random identifier is presented in Appendix A.6 . Although the probability of multiple sources choosing the same identifier is low   all RTP implementations must be prepared to detect and resolve collisions . Section 8 describes the probability of collision along with a mechanism for resolving collisions and detecting RTP-level forwarding loops based on the uniqueness of the SSRC identifier . If a source changes its source transport address   it must also choose a new SSRC identifier to avoid being interpreted as a looped source ( see Section 8.2 ). ,230,3550,field
1004092,V,version ( V ): 2 bits Identifies the version of RTP   which is the same in RTCP packets as in RTP data packets . The version defined by this specification is two ( 2 ). ,220,3550,field
1004093,P,padding ( P ): 1 bit If the padding bit is set   this individual RTCP packet contains some additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the control information but are included in the length field . The last octet of the padding is a count of how many padding octets should be ignored   including itself ( it will be a multiple of four ). Padding may be needed by some encryption algorithms with fixed block sizes . In a compound RTCP packet   padding is only required on one individual packet because the compound packet is encrypted as a whole for the method in Section 9.1 . Thus   padding MUST only be added to the last individual packet   and if padding is added to that packet   the padding bit MUST be set only on that packet . This convention aids the header validity checks described in Appendix A.2 and allows detection of packets from some early implementations that incorrectly set the padding bit on the first individual packet and add padding to the last individual packet . ,231,3550,field
1004094,RC,reception report count ( RC ): 5 bits The number of reception report blocks contained in this packet . A value of zero is valid . ,200,3550,field

1004096,length,length : 16 bits The length of this RTCP packet in 32-bit words minus one   including the header and any padding . ( The offset of one makes zero a valid length and avoids a possible infinite loop in scanning a compound RTCP packet   while counting 32-bit words avoids a validity check for a multiple of 4 .) ,100,3550,field
1004097,SSRC,SSRC : 32 bits The synchronization source identifier for the originator of this SR packet . ,230,3550,field
1004098,RTP timestamp,RTP timestamp : 32 bits Corresponds to the same time as the NTP timestamp ( above )  but in the same units and with the same random offset as the RTP timestamps in data packets . This correspondence may be used for intra - and inter-media synchronization for sources whose NTP timestamps are synchronized   and may be used by media-independent receivers to estimate the nominal RTP clock frequency . Note that in most cases this timestamp will not be equal to the RTP timestamp in any adjacent data packet . Rather   it MUST be calculated from the corresponding NTP timestamp using the relationship between the RTP timestamp counter and real time as maintained by periodically checking the wallclock time at a sampling instant . ,122,3550,field
1004099,sender's packet count,sender's packet count : 32 bits The total number of RTP data packets transmitted by the sender since starting transmission up until the time this SR packet was generated . The count SHOULD be reset if the sender changes its SSRC identifier . ,200,3550,field
1004100,sender's octet count,sender's octet count : 32 bits The total number of payload octets ( i.e .  not including header or padding ) transmitted in RTP data packets by the sender since starting transmission up until the time this SR packet was generated . The count SHOULD be reset if the sender changes its SSRC identifier . This field can be used to estimate the average payload data rate . ,100,3550,field
1004101,fraction lost,fraction lost : 8 bits The fraction of RTP data packets from source SSRC_n lost since the previous SR or RR packet was sent   expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point at the left edge of the field . ( That is equivalent to taking the integer part after multiplying the loss fraction by 256 .) This fraction is defined to be the number of packets lost divided by the number of packets expected   as defined in the next paragraph . An implementation is shown in Appendix A.3 . If the loss is negative due to duplicates   the fraction lost is set to zero . Note that a receiver cannot tell whether any packets were lost after the last one received   and that there will be no reception report block issued for a source if all packets from that source sent during the last reporting interval have been lost . ,302,3550,field
1004102,cumulative number of packets lost,cumulative number of packets lost : 24 bits The total number of RTP data packets from source SSRC_n that have been lost since the beginning of reception . This number is defined to be the number of packets expected less the number of packets actually received   where the number of packets received includes any which are late or duplicates . Thus   packets that arrive late are not counted as lost   and the loss may be negative if there are duplicates . The number of packets expected is defined to be the extended last sequence number received   as defined next   less the initial sequence number received . This may be calculated as shown in Appendix A.3 . ,201,3550,field
1004103,extended highest sequence number received,extended highest sequence number received : 32 bits The low 16 bits contain the highest sequence number received in an RTP data packet from source SSRC_n   and the most significant 16 bits extend that sequence number with the corresponding count of sequence number cycles   which may be maintained according to the algorithm in Appendix A.1 . Note that different receivers within the same session will generate different extensions to the sequence number if their start times differ significantly . ,200,3550,field
1004104,interarrival jitter,interarrival jitter : 32 bits An estimate of the statistical variance of the RTP data packet interarrival time   measured in timestamp units and expressed as an unsigned integer . The interarrival jitter J is defined to be the mean deviation ( smoothed absolute value ) of the difference D in packet spacing at the receiver compared to the sender for a pair of packets . As shown in the equation below   this is equivalent to the difference in the " relative transit time " for the two packets; ,122,3550,field

The application creator might choose to use the application name   and then coordinate the allocation of subtype values to others who want to define new packet types for the application . Alternatively   it is RECOMMENDED that others choose a name based on the entity they represent   then coordinate the use of the name within that entity . The name is interpreted as a sequence of four ASCII characters   with uppercase and lowercase characters treated as distinct . ,231,3550,field
1004121,LLL,Interleave Length ( LLL ): 3 bits Indicates the length of interleave; a value of 0 indicates bundling   a special case of interleaving . See Section 6 and Section 7 for more detailed discussion . ,100,3558,field

1004125,padding,Padding ( padding ): 0 or 4 bits This padding ensures that codec data frames start on an octet boundary . When the frame count is odd   the sender MUST add 4 bits of padding following the last TOC . When the frame count is even   the sender MUST NOT add padding bits . If padding is present   the padding bits MUST be set to zero by sender   and SHOULD be ignored by receiver . ,210,3558,field

In the case of an IP phone   this could be acoustic coupling between handset speaker and microphone or residual acoustic echo from speakerphone operation   and may more correctly be termed terminal coupling loss ( TCL ). A typical handset would result in 40-50 dB of echo loss due to acoustic feedback . ,400,3611,field

When PLC = 10   then an enhanced interpolation algorithm is being used; algorithms of this type are able to conceal high packet loss rates effectively . When PLC = 01   then silence is being inserted in place of lost packets .

When the L2TP control connection is used for session establishment   Session IDs are selected and exchanged as Local Session ID AVPs during the creation of a session . The Session ID alone provides the necessary context for all further packet processing   including the presence   size   and value of the Cookie   the type of L2-Specific Sublayer   and the type of payload being tunneled . ,202,3931,field
1004640,Ns,The message sequence number   Ns   begins at 0 . Each subsequent message is sent with the next increment of the sequence number . The sequence number is thus a free-running counter represented modulo 65536 . The sequence number in the header of a received message is considered less than or equal to the last received number if its value lies in the range of the last received number and the preceding 32767 values   inclusive . For example   if the last received sequence number was 15   then messages with sequence numbers 0 through 15   as well as 32784 through 65535   would be considered less than or equal . Such a message would be considered a duplicate of a message already received and ignored from processing . However   in order to ensure that all messages are acknowledged properly ( particularly in the case of a lost ACK message )  receipt of duplicate messages MUST be acknowledged by the reliable delivery mechanism . This acknowledgment may either piggybacked on a message in queue or sent explicitly via an ACK message . ,201,3931,field

1004649,M,The Mandatory ( M ) bit within the Message Type AVP has special meaning . Rather than an indication as to whether the AVP itself should be ignored if not recognized   it is an indication as to whether the control message itself should be ignored . If the M bit is set within the Message Type AVP and the Message Type is unknown to the implementation   the control connection MUST be cleared . If the M bit is not set   then the implementation may ignore an unknown message type . The M bit MUST be set to 1 for all message types defined in this document .

1005372,BLP,bitmask of following lost packets ( BLP ): 16 bits The BLP allows for reporting losses of any of the 16 RTP packets immediately following the RTP packet indicated by the PID . The BLP's definition is identical to that given in [ 6 ]. Denoting the BLP's least significant bit as bit 1   and its most significant bit as bit 16   then bit i of the bit mask is set to 1 if the receiver has not received RTP packet number ( PID+i ) ( modulo 2^16 ) and indicates this packet is lost; bit i is set to 0 otherwise . Note that the sender MUST NOT assume that a receiver has received a packet because its bit mask was set to 0 . For example   the least significant bit of the BLP would be set to 1 if the packet corresponding to the PID and the following packet have been lost . However   the sender cannot infer that packets PID+2 through PID+16 have been received simply because bits 2 through 15 of the BLP are 0; all the sender knows is that the receiver has not reported them as lost at this time . ,231,4585,field

1005383,GOBN,Encodes the GOB number in effect at the start of the packet . Set to 0 if the packet begins with a GOB header . ,200,4587,field
1005384,MBAP,Encodes the macroblock address predictor ( i.e .  the last MBA encoded in the previous packet ).

In the case of corruption or loss of the thread 0 representation   a representation of the sync frame with a higher thread number can be used by the decoder . Lower thread numbers are expected to contain representations of the sync frames equal to or better than higher thread numbers in the absence of data corruption or loss .

1005719,DSRC,DSRC : 32 bits - Data Source identifier represents a unique RAQMON reporting session descriptor that points to a specific reporting session between RDS and RRC . Uniqueness of DSRC is valid only within a reporting session . DSRC values should be randomly generated using vendor-chosen algorithms for each communication session . It is not sufficient to obtain a DSRC simply by calling random () without carefully initializing the state . One could use an algorithm like the one defined in Appendix A.6 in [ RFC3550 ] to create a DSRC . Depending on the choice of algorithm   there is a finite probability that two DSRCs from two different RDSs may be the same . To further reduce the probability that two RDSs pick the same DSRC for two different reporting sessions   it is recommended that an RRC use parameters like Data Source Address ( DA )  Data Source Name ( DN )  and layer 2 Media Access Control ( MAC ) Address in the PDU in conjunction with a DSRC value . It is not mandatory for RDSs to send parameters like Data Source Address ( DA )  Data Source Name ( DN )  and MAC Address in every PDU sent to RRC   but occasionally sending these parameters will reduce the probability of DSRC collision drastically . However   this will cause an additional overhead per PDU . ,231,4712,field

1005954,Highest,This field contains an unsigned integer representing the highest protocol version supported by the sender . If a value provided by a peer to an EAP server falls between the server's " Highest " and " Lowest " supported version ( inclusive )  then that value will be the negotiated version for the authentication session . ,220,4793,field
1005955,Lowest,This field contains an unsigned integer representing the lowest version acceptable by the EAP server . The field MUST be present in an EAP-Request . The field MUST NOT be present in an EAP - Response . A peer SHALL respond to an EAP-Request of type POTP-X with an EAP-Response of type Nak ( 3 ) if the peer's highest supported version is lower than the value of this field . ,231,4793,field
1005956,M,1 - Mandatory TLV ,240,4793,field

1005961,N,The N bit signals that the peer MUST NOT attempt to resume any session it has stored associated with this server . ,500,4793,field
1005962,Session Identifier,An 8-octet identifier for the session about to be negotiated . Note that   in the case of session resumption   this session identifier will not be used ( the session identifier for the resumed session will continue to be used ). ,202,4793,field

1005967,Reserved,Reserved for future use . All 9 bits SHALL be set to zero ( 0 ) for this version . Recipients SHALL ignore these bits for this version of EAP-POTP . ,500,4793,field
1005968,A,The A bit MUST be set in an EAP-Request if and only if the request immediately follows an EAP-Response of type POTP-X containing a New PIN TLV ( see Section 4.11.5 )  and the new PIN in the response was accepted by the EAP server . In this case   the A bit signals that the EAP-server has accepted the PIN   and that the peer SHALL use the newly established PIN when calculating the response ( when applicable ). The A bit MUST NOT be set if the S bit is set . If a request has both the S bit and the A bit set   the peer SHALL regard the request as invalid   and return an empty POTP-X EAP - Response message . ,210,4793,field
1005969,P,In an EAP-Request   the P bit indicates that the OTP in the response MUST be protected . Use of this bit also indicates that mutual authentication will take place   as well as generation of keying material . It is RECOMMENDED to always set the P bit . If a peer receives an EAP-Request with an OTP TLV that does not have the P bit set   and the peer's policy dictates protected mode   the peer MUST respond with an empty POTP-X EAP-Response message . All peers MUST support protected mode . ,210,4793,field
1005970,C,The C bit carries meaning only when the OTP algorithm in question makes use of server challenges . For other OTP algorithms   the C bit SHALL always be set to zero . ,210,4793,field
1005971,N,In an EAP-Request   the N bit   when set   indicates that the OTP to calculate SHALL be based on the next token " state "  and not the current one . As an example   for a time-based token   this means the next time slot . For an event-based token   this could mean the next counter value   if counter values are used . This bit will normally not be set in initial EAP-Request messages   but may be set in subsequent ones . Further   the N bit carries no meaning in an EAP-Request if a challenge is present and the C bit is not set   and SHALL be set to 0   in this case . If a request that has the N bit set also contains a challenge   but does not have the C bit set   the peer SHALL regard the request as invalid   and return an empty POTP-X EAP-Response message . Note that setting the N bit in an EAP-Request will normally advance the internal state of the token . ,210,4793,field
1005972,T,The T bit only carries meaning for OTP methods normally incorporating a user PIN in the OTP computation . ,231,4793,field
1005973,E,In an EAP-Request   the E bit   when set   indicates that the peer MUST NOT use any stored pepper value associated with this server in the PBKDF2 computation . Rather   it MUST generate a new pepper ( if supported by the peer ) and/or use the iteration count parameter to protect the OTP ( if the server's Max Pepper Length is 0   then the peer MUST rely on the iteration count only to protect the OTP ). This bit will usually not be set in initial EAP-Request messages   but may be set in subsequent ones   e.g .  if the server   upon receipt of an OTP TLV with a pepper identifier   detects that it does not have a pepper with that identifier in storage . This bit carries no meaning   and MUST be set to zero   when the P bit is not set . If a request has the E bit set but not the P bit   a peer SHALL regard the request as invalid   and return an empty POTP-X EAP-Response message . ,210,4793,field
1005974,S,In an EAP-Request   the S bit (" Same ")  when set   indicates that the peer SHOULD calculate its response based on the same OTP value as was used for the preceding response . This bit MAY be set when the EAP server has received an OTP TLV from the peer protected with a pepper   of which the server is no longer in possession . Since the server has not attempted validation of the provided data   there is no need for the EAP peer to retrieve a new OTP value . This bit carries no meaning   and MUST be set to zero   when the E bit is not set . A peer SHALL regard a request where the S bit is set   but not the E bit   as invalid   and return an empty POTP-X EAP-Response message . Further   the S bit MUST NOT be set when the A bit also is set; see above . ,210,4793,field
1005975,Pepper Length,This octet SHALL be present if and only if the P bit is set . When present   it contains an unsigned integer   having a value between 0 and 255 ( inclusive ). In an EAP-Request   the integer represents the maximum length ( in bits ) of a client-generated pepper the server is prepared to search for . Peers MUST NOT generate peppers longer than this value . If the value is set to zero   it means the peer MUST NOT generate a pepper for the PBKDF2 calculation . In an EAP-Response   it indicates the length of the used pepper . ,301,4793,field
1005976,Iteration Count,These 4 octets SHALL be present if and only if the P bit is set . When present   they contain an unsigned   4-octet integer in network byte order . In an EAP-Request   the integer represents the maximum iteration count the peer may use in the PBKDF2 computation . Peers MUST NOT use iteration counts higher than this value . In an EAP - Response   it indicates the actual iteration count used . ,301,4793,field
1005977,Authentication Data,EAP-Request : In an EAP-Request   the Authentication Data field   when present   contains an optional " challenge ". The challenge is an octet string that SHOULD be uniquely generated for each request in which it is present ( i.e .  it is a " nonce ")  and SHOULD be 8 octets or longer . To avoid fragmentation ( i.e .  EAP messages longer than the minimum EAP MTU size; see [ 1 ])  the challenge MUST NOT be longer than 64 octets . When the challenge is not present   the OTP will be calculated on the current token state only . The peer MAY ignore a provided challenge if and only if the OTP token the peer is interacting with is not capable of including a challenge in the OTP calculation . In this case   EAP server policies will determine whether or not to accept a provided OTP value . ,400,4793,field
1005978,M,1 - Mandatory TLV ,240,4793,field

The high-order octet is 0 and the low-order 3 octets are the Structure of Management Information ( SMI ) Network Management Private Enterprise Code of the Vendor in network byte order . The Vendor-Id field MUST be zero for TLVs that are not Vendor-Specific TLVs . For Vendor-Specific TLVs   the Vendor-ID MUST be set to the SMI code . ,301,4793,field

1005989,Q,The Q bit   when set in an EAP-Request   indicates that an accompanying PIN is required   i.e .  the peer ( user ) is not free to choose another PIN . When the Q bit is set   there MUST be an accompanying PIN and the provided PIN MUST be used in subsequent OTP generations . A peer SHALL respond with an empty POTP-X EAP - Response message if the Q bit is set but there is not any accompanying PIN . When the Q bit is not set   any provided PIN is suggested only   and the peer is free to choose another PIN   subject to local policy . ,210,4793,field
1005990,A,This bit allows methods that distinguish between two different PIN types ( e.g .  decimal vs . alphanumeric ) to designate whether the augmented set is to be used ( when set ) or not ( when not set ). The A bit carries no meaning   and SHALL be set to zero   in an EAP - Response . ,210,4793,field
1005991,PIN Length,This field contains an unsigned integer representing the length of the provided PIN ( this implies that the maximum length of a PIN will be 255 octets ). ,100,4793,field
1005992,Min . PIN Length,This field MAY be present in an EAP-Request . This field MUST NOT be present in an EAP-Response . It SHALL be interpreted as an unsigned integer in network byte order representing the minimum length allowed for a new PIN . ,400,4793,field
1005993,Max . PIN Length,This field MUST NOT be present in an EAP-Request unless the Min . PIN Length field is present   in which case it MAY be present . The field MUST NOT be present in an EAP-Response . It SHALL be interpreted as an unsigned integer in network byte order representing the maximum length allowed for a new PIN .

1006472,0x83,A TE-Summary network LSA may be used to advertise reachability of TE-networks accessible to areas external to the originating area . The content and the flooding scope of a TE-Summary LSA is different from that of a native Summary LSA . ,231,4973,field
1006473,0x84,A TE-Summary router LSA may be used to advertise the availability of area border routers ( ABRs ) and AS border routers ( ASBRs ) that are TE-capable . The TE-Summary router LSAs are originated by the Area Border Routers . The scope of flooding for the TE-Summary router LSA is the non-backbone area the advertising ABR belongs to . ,400,4973,field
1006474,Link State ID,The ID of the area border router or the AS border router whose TE capability is being advertised . ,230,4973,field
1006475,Advertising Router,The ABR that advertises its TE capabilities ( and the OSPF areas it belongs to ) or the TE capabilities of an ASBR within one of the areas for which the ABR is a border router . ,231,4973,field
1006476,No . of Areas,Specifies the number of OSPF areas the link state ID belongs to . ,231,4973,field
1006477,Area-ID,Specifies the OSPF area(s ) the link state ID belongs to . When the link state ID is same as the advertising router ID   the Area-ID lists all the areas the ABR belongs to . In the case the link state ID is an ASBR   the Area-ID simply lists the area the ASBR belongs to .

1006480,0x85,TE-AS-external LSAs are the Type 0x85 LSAs . This is modeled after AS-external LSA format and flooding scope . TE-AS-external LSAs are originated by AS boundary routers with TE extensions   and describe the TE networks and pre-engineered circuit paths external to the AS . As with AS-external LSA   the flooding scope of the TE-AS-external LSA is AS-wide   with the exception of stub areas . ,400,4973,field
1006481,Network Mask,The IP address mask for the advertised TE destination . For example   this can be used to specify access to a specific TE node or TE link with an mask of 0xffffffff . This can also be used to specify access to an aggregated set of destinations using a different mask . ex : 0xff000000 . ,230,4973,field
1006482,Link-TE flags,The TE attributes of this route . These fields are optional and are provided only when one or more pre-engineered circuits can be specified with the advertisement . Without these fields   the LSA will simply state TE reachability info . ,400,4973,field
1006483,Link-TE TLVs,The TE attributes of this route . These fields are optional and are provided only when one or more pre-engineered circuits can be specified with the advertisement . Without these fields   the LSA will simply state TE reachability info . ,400,4973,field
1006484,Forwarding address,Data traffic for the advertised destination will be forwarded to this address . If the Forwarding address is set to 0.0.0.0   data traffic will be forwarded instead to the LSA's originator ( i.e .  the responsible AS boundary router ). ,230,4973,field
1006485,External Route Tag,A 32-bit field attached to each external route . This is not used by the OSPF protocol itself . It may be used to communicate information between AS boundary routers; the precise nature of such information is outside the scope of this specification . ,400,4973,field
1006486,0x81,The following fields are used to describe each router link ( i.e .  interface ). Each router link is typed ( see the below Type field ). The Type field indicates the kind of link being described . ,240,4973,field
1006487,Type,A new link type " Positional-Ring Type " ( value 5 ) is defined . This is essentially a connection to a TDM-Ring . TDM ring network is different from LAN/NBMA transit network in that nodes on the TDM ring do not necessarily have a terminating path between themselves . Second   the order of links is important in determining the circuit path . Third   the protection switching and the number of fibers from a node going into a ring are determined by the ring characteristics   for example   2-fiber vs . 4-fiber ring and Unidirectional Path Switched Ring ( UPSR ) vs . Bidirectional Line Switched Ring ( BLSR ). ,231,4973,field
1006488,Type,Type Description __________________________________________________ 1 Point-to-point connection to another router 2 Connection to a transit network 3 Connection to a stub network 4 Virtual link 5 Positional-Ring type . ,240,4973,field
1006489,Link ID,Identifies the object that this router link connects to . Value depends on the link's Type . For a positional-ring type   the Link ID shall be IP Network/Subnet number just as the case with a broadcast transit network . The following table summarizes the updated Link ID values . ,231,4973,field
1006490,Type,Type Link ID ______________________________________ 1 Neighboring router's Router ID 2 IP address of Designated Router 3 IP network/subnet number 4 Neighboring router's Router ID 5 IP network/subnet number ,240,4973,field

1006493,LSC,TDM   LSC   FSC bits - Same as defined for router TE options . ,400,4973,field
1006494,0x82,Network LSA is adequate for packet TE networks . A new TE - positional-ring-network LSA is defined to represent type-5 link networks   found in non-packet networks such as SONET/SDH TDM rings . A type-5 ring is a collection of network elements ( NEs ) forming a closed loop . Each NE is connected to two adjacent NEs via a duplex connection to provide redundancy in the ring . The sequence in which the NEs are placed on the Ring is pertinent . The NE that provides the OSPF-xTE functionality is termed the Gateway Network Element ( GNE ). The GNE selection criteria is outside the scope of this document . The GNE is also termed the Designated Router for the ring . ,400,4973,field
1006495,Link State ID,This is the IP interface address of the network's Gateway Network Element   which is also the designated router . ,230,4973,field
1006496,Advertising Router,Router ID of the network's Designated Router . ,230,4973,field
1006497,Capacity Unit,Two units are currently defined   as follows . ,400,4973,field
1006498,Ring capacity,Ring capacity expressed in number of Capacity Units . ,100,4973,field
1006499,Network Element Node Id,The Router ID of each of the routers in the positional-ring network . The list must start with the designated router as the first element . The Network Elements ( NEs ) must be listed in strict clockwise order as they appear on the ring   starting with the Gateway Network Element ( GNE ). The number of NEs in the ring can be deduced from the LSA header's length field . ,230,4973,field
1006500,0x8e,This is a variation to the TE-router LSA in that the TE-router LSA is not advertised by the network element   but rather by a trusted TE - router Proxy . This is typically the scenario in a non-packet TE network   where some of the nodes do not have OSPF functionality and count on a helper node to do the advertisement for them . One such example would be the SONET/SDH Add-Drop Multiplexer ( ADM ) nodes in a TDM ring . The nodes may principally depend upon the GNE ( Gateway Network Element ) to do the advertisement for them . TE-router-Proxy LSA shall not be used to advertise area border routers and/or AS border routers . ,301,4973,field
1006501,Type,The OSPF interface type can also be of type " Positional-Ring ". The Positional-Ring type is different from other types ( such as broadcast and NBMA ) in that the exact location of the nodes on the ring is relevant   even though they are all on the same ring . SONET ADM ring is a good example of this . Complete ring positional-ring description may be provided by the GNE on a ring as a TE-network LSA for the ring . ,231,4973,field

1006947,Locator,This document defines a generalization of an address called a " locator ". A locator specifies a point-of-attachment to the network but may also include additional end-to-end tunneling or per-host demultiplexing context that affects how packets are handled below the logical HIP sublayer of the stack . This generalization is useful because IP addresses alone may not be sufficient to describe how packets should be handled below HIP . For example   in a host multihoming context   certain IP addresses may need to be associated with certain ESP SPIs to avoid violating the ESP anti-replay window . Addresses may also be affiliated with transport ports in certain tunneling scenarios . Locators may simply be traditional network addresses . The format of the locator fields in the LOCATOR parameter is defined in Section 4 . ,230,5206,field

1008242,Pri,o Pri ( Priority - 3 bits ): the Priority field may be used by the requesting PCC to specify to the PCE the request's priority from 1 to 7 . The decision of which priority should be used for a specific request is a local matter; it MUST be set to 0 when unused . Furthermore   the use of the path computation request priority by the PCE's scheduler is implementation specific and out of the scope of this document . Note that it is not required for a PCE to support the priority field : in this case   it is RECOMMENDED that the PCC set the priority field to 0 in the RP object . If the PCE does not take into account the request priority   it is RECOMMENDED to set the priority field to 0 in the RP object carried within the corresponding PCRep message   regardless of the priority value contained in the RP object carried within the corresponding PCReq message . A higher numerical value of the priority field reflects a higher priority . Note that it is the responsibility of the network administrator to make use of the priority values in a consistent manner across the various PCCs . The ability of a PCE to support request prioritization MAY be dynamically discovered by the PCCs by means of PCE capability discovery . If not advertised by the PCE   a PCC may decide to set the request priority and will learn the ability of the PCE to support request prioritization by observing the Priority field of the RP object received in the PCRep message . If the value of the Pri field is set to 0   this means that the PCE does not support ,230,5440,field

Also   for all TE LSPs except zero-bandwidth LSPs   when the R bit is set   the existing bandwidth of the TE LSP to be reoptimized MUST be supplied in a BANDWIDTH object ( see Section 7.7 ). This BANDWIDTH object is in addition to the instance of that object used to describe the desired bandwidth of the reoptimized LSP .

1008760,NDB,Number of distribution buckets ( NDB ): 12 bits The number of distribution buckets of data . The size of each bucket can be calculated using the formula (( length * 4 ) - 12 ) * 8 / NDB number of bits . The calculation is based on the length of the whole sub-report block in octets ( length * 4 ) minus the header of 12 octets . Providing 12 bits for the NDB field enables bucket sizes as small as 2 bits for a full - length packet of MTU 1500 bytes . The bucket size in bits must always be divisible by 2 to ensure proper byte alignment . A bucket size of 2 bits is fairly restrictive   however   and it is expected that larger bucket sizes will be more practical for most distributions . ,400,5760,field
1008761,MF,Multiplicative Factor ( MF ): 4 bits 2^MF indicates the multiplicative factor to be applied to each distribution bucket value . Possible values of MF are 0 - 15   creating a range of values from MF = 1   2   4 ... 32768 .

1008762,Length,Length : 8 bits The length field tells the receiver the full length of the sub - report block in 32-bit words ( i.e .  length * 4 bytes ) and enables the receiver to identify the bucket size . For example   given no MTU restrictions   the data portion of a distribution packet may be only as large as 1008 bytes ( 255 * 4 - 12 )  providing up to 4032 data buckets of length 2 bits   or 2016 data buckets of length 4 bits   etc . ,100,5760,field

The string MAY contain Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications ( IDNA ) domain names and MUST be UTF-8 encoded [ 11 ]. ,230,5760,field
1008767,Collision SSRC,Collision SSRC : n * 32 bits This field contains a list of SSRCs that are duplicated within the group . Usually this is handled by the hosts upon detection of the same SSRC; however   since receivers in an SSM session using the Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model no longer have a global view of the session   the collision algorithm is handled by the Distribution Source . SSRCs that collide are listed in the packet . Each Collision SSRC is reported only once for each collision detection . If more Collision SSRCs need to be reported than fit into an MTU   the reporting is done in a round robin fashion so that all Collision SSRCs have been reported once before the second round of reporting starts . On receipt of the packet   receiver(s ) MUST detect the collision and select another SSRC   if the collision pertains to them . ,400,5760,field
1008768,SRBT,Collision detection is only possible at the Distribution Source . If the Distribution Source and Feedback Target functions are disjoint and collision reporting across RTP receiver SSRCs shall be provided   the Feedback Targets(s ) MUST forward the RTCP reports from the RTP receivers   including at least the RR and the SDES packets to the Distribution Source . ,301,5760,field

TrailerLen MUST be set to zero when using ESP with encryption . The receiver MUST only accept the packet if this field matches with the value computed from using the negotiated SA . This ensures that sender is not deliberately setting this value to obfuscate a part of the payload from examination by a trusted intermediary device . ,100,5840,field
1008941,Flags,Flags   8 bits : The bits are defined most-significant-bit ( MSB ) first   so bit 0 is the most significant bit of the flags octet . ,231,5840,field
1008942,E,Encrypted Payload ( E )  1 bit : Setting the Encrypted Payload bit to 1 indicates that the WESP ( and therefore ESP ) payload is protected with encryption . If this bit is set to 0   then the payload is using integrity-only ESP . Setting or clearing this bit also impacts the value in the WESP Next Header field   as described above . The recipient MUST ensure consistency of this flag with the negotiated policy and MUST drop the incoming packet otherwise . ,210,5840,field
1008943,P,Padding header ( P )  1 bit : If set ( value 1 )  the 4-octet padding is present . If not set ( value 0 )  the 4-octet padding is absent .

If WESP is being used with UDP encapsulation ( see Section 2.1 below ) and IPv6   the Protocol Identifier ( 0x00000002 ) occupies 4 octets so the IPv6 padding is not needed   as the header is already on an 8-octet boundary . This padding MUST NOT be used with IPv4   as it is not needed to guarantee 4-octet IPv4 alignment . ,210,5840,field
1008944,Rsvd,Rsvd   4 bits : Reserved for future use . The reserved bits MUST be sent as 0   and ignored by the receiver . Future documents defining any of these bits MUST NOT affect the distinction between encrypted and unencrypted packets or the semantics of HdrLen . In other words   even if new bits are defined   old implementations will be able to find the encapsulated packet correctly . Intermediate nodes dealing with unknown reserved bits are not necessarily able to parse the packet correctly . Intermediate treatment of such packets is policy dependent ( e.g .  it may dictate dropping such packets ). ,500,5840,field

Each GIST node can therefore see every such message   but unless the message exactly matches the Q-mode encapsulation rules ( Section 5.3.2 ) it MUST be forwarded transparently at the IP level . If it does match   GIST MUST check the NSLPID in the common header . The case where the NSLPID does not match a local signalling application at all is considered below in Section 4.3.4; otherwise   the message MUST be passed up to the GIST layer for further processing . ,400,5971,field

1009213,Message Routing Information,For the path-coupled MRM   the message routing information ( MRI ) is conceptually the Flow Identifier as in the NSIS framework [ 29 ]. Minimally   this could just be the flow destination address; however   to account for policy-based forwarding and other issues a more complete set of header fields SHOULD be specified if possible ( see Section 4.3.4 and Section 7.2 for further discussion ). ,230,5971,field

1009962,Token Element,o Token Element ( variable size ): Element that is used to carry the Token generated by the server . This element is a 32-bit aligned Length-Value element . The Length field   which is 16 bits   indicates the length ( in octets ) of the Value field that follows the Length field . While a 16-bit length allows for Tokens with a size of up to 65535 bytes   using Tokens of sizes that make the RTCP compound packet larger than the MTU might have a negative impact on functionality because of IP fragmentation . Some NATs or other middleboxes do not pass IP fragments; thus   a large Token can cause the whole mechanism to fail . In addition   fragmentation increases the risk for packet loss . ,100,6284,field
1009963,Absolute Expiration Time,o Absolute Expiration Time ( 64 bits ): Field that contains the absolute expiration time of the Token . The absolute expiration time is expressed as a Network Time Protocol ( NTP ) timestamp value in seconds since the year 1900 [ RFC5905 ]. The client does not need to use this element directly and thus does not need to synchronize its clock with the server . However   the client needs to send this element back to the server along with the associated nonce in the Token Verification Request message and thus needs to keep it associated with the Token . ,121,6284,field
1009964,Relative Expiration Time,o Relative Expiration Time ( 32 bits ): Field that contains the relative expiration time of the Token . The relative expiration time is expressed in seconds from the time the Token was generated . Whenever a server decides to not grant a Token to a requesting client   the relative expiration time will be set to zero ( and hence   the accompanying Token will be invalid ). ,122,6284,field
1009965,Packet Types Element,o Packet Types Element ( variable size ): Element that is used to signal which RTCP packet types require Token-based authentication . This element is a 32-bit aligned Length-Value element . The Length field   which is 8 bits   indicates the length ( in octets ) of the Value field that follows the Length field . This length does not include any padding that is required for alignment . The Value field carries zero or more 8-bit sub-fields   each carrying an RTCP packet type . If the Packet Types element does not fall on a ,400,6284,field

1009969,SSRC of Packet Sender,o SSRC of Packet Sender : This is the server's SSRC   which equals the SSRC of the respective multicast stream . Note that this SSRC value is from a different SSRC space than the one used in the unicast session . ,231,6284,field
1009970,SSRC of Requesting Client,o SSRC of Requesting Client ( 32 bits ): Field that contains the SSRC of the client . ,400,6284,field
1009971,Failed PT,o Failed PT ( 8 bits ): Field that indicates the type of the RTCP packet that caused this failure message . ,231,6284,field
1009972,FMT,o FMT ( 5 bits ): Field that indicates the feedback message type ( FMT ) value of the RTCP packet that caused this failure . Together with the field above   the client can infer which RTCP message it had previously sent caused this failure message to be sent by the server . For example   if the client did not include a valid Token with an RTCP NACK message   the Failed PT field will indicate 205 ( RTPFB ) and the FMT field will indicate 1 ( Generic NACK ). If the RTCP message did not have an associated FMT value ( such as an RTCP BYE message )  the FMT field SHALL be set to zero . ,231,6284,field
1009973,Associated Nonce,o Associated Nonce ( 64 bits ): Field that contains the nonce received in the Token Verification Request message . If there was no Token Verification Request message included by the client   this field is set to zero . ,400,6284,field

The limits can include local receiver limits as well as network limits that are known to the receiver . ,231,6285,field
1009980,Type,o Preamble-only Allowed ( 0 bits ): Optional TLV element that indicates that the RTP_Rx is willing to receive only the preamble information for the desired primary multicast stream(s ) in case the BRS cannot send the unicast burst stream(s ). ( In such cases   the BRS will not accept the request   but will send a response code 511 in the RAMS-I message as defined in Section 11.6 .) Note that ,302,6285,field
1009981,Type,o Supported Enterprise Number(s ): Optional TLV element that indicates the enterprise number(s ) that the RTP_Rx implementation supports . Similar to the private extensions   the enterprise numbers here are as listed on http://www.iana.org . This TLV element   if exists   provides a hint to the BRS about which private extensions the RTP_Rx can potentially support . Note that an RTP_Rx does not necessarily support all the private extensions under a particular enterprise number . Unless the BRS explicitly knows which private extensions an RTP_Rx supports ( through this or some out-of-band means )  the BRS SHOULD NOT use private extensions in the RAMS-I messages . The BRS SHOULD rather use only vendor - neutral extensions . The Length field of this TLV element is set to 4*n   where n is the number of enterprise number entries . ,231,6285,field

1009983,MSN,o Message Sequence Number ( MSN ) ( 8 bits ) : Mandatory field that denotes the sequence number of the RAMS-I message for the particular media sender SSRC specified in the message header . The MSN value SHALL be set to zero when a new RAMS request is received . During rapid acquisition   the same RAMS-I message MAY be repeated for redundancy purposes without incrementing the MSN value . If an updated RAMS-I message will be sent ( either with new information or updated information )  the MSN value SHALL be incremented by one . In the MSN field   the regular wrapping rules apply . Note that if the RTP_Rx has sent an updated request   it MUST check every RAMS-I message entirely   regardless of whether or not the MSN value has changed . ,200,6285,field
1009984,Response,o Response ( 16 bits ): Mandatory field that denotes the response code for this RAMS-I message . This document defines several initial response codes in Section 7.3.1 and registers them with IANA in Section 11.6 . If a new vendor-neutral response code will be defined   it MUST be registered with IANA through the guidelines specified in Section 11.6 . If the new response code is intended to be used privately by a vendor   there is no need for IANA management . Instead   the vendor MUST use the private extension mechanism ( Section 7.1.2 ) to convey its message and MUST indicate this by putting zero in the Response field . ,231,6285,field
1009985,Type,o RTP Seqnum of the First Packet ( 16 bits ): TLV element that specifies the RTP sequence number of the first packet that will be sent in the respective unicast RTP stream . This allows the RTP_Rx to know whether one or more packets sent by the BRS have been dropped at the beginning of the stream . If the BRS accepts the RAMS request   this element exists . If the BRS rejects the RAMS request   this element SHALL NOT exist . ,200,6285,field
1009986,Type,o Earliest Multicast Join Time ( 32 bits ): TLV element that specifies the delta time ( in ms ) between the arrival of the first RTP packet in the unicast RTP stream ( which could be a burst packet or a payload-specific packet ) and the earliest time instant when an RTP_Rx MAY send an SFGMP Join message to join the multicast session . A zero value indicated in this element means that the RTP_Rx MAY send the SFGMP Join message right away . If the RTP_Rx does not want to wait until the earliest multicast join time   it MAY send a RAMS-T message   and after a reasonable amount of time   it MAY join the SSM session . ,122,6285,field
1009987,Type,o Burst Duration ( 32 bits ): Optional TLV element that denotes the time the burst will last ( in ms )  i.e .  the difference between the expected transmission times of the first and the last burst packets that the BRS is planning to send in the respective unicast RTP stream . In the absence of additional stimulus   the BRS will ,122,6285,field

1010023,S,To enable RPF globally for an ( S G )  the multicast-enabled RBR ( mRBR ) must at the source's ALOC realm replace the value of the source address field in the IP header with the local ALOC prefix for inter - ALOC multicast streams . This can be achieved if the local RBR acts also as an anycast Rendezvous Point with MSDP and PIM capabilities . With these functionalities the RBR becomes a multicast-enabled RBR ( mRBR ). The source registers at the mRBR and a source tree is established between the source and the mRBR . When an inter-ALOC realm receiver subscribes to the multicast group   the mRBR has to swap the hIPv4 header in the following way : ,230,6306,field

1010202,Ingress RBridge Nickname,o Ingress RBridge Nickname : 16-bit identifier . See Section 3.7.2 . ,231,6325,field
1010203,V,Version ( V ) is a 2-bit field . Version zero of TRILL is specified in this document . An RBridge RB1 MUST check the V field in a received TRILL-encapsulated frame . If the V field has a value not recognized by RB1   then RB1 MUST silently discard the frame . The allocation of new TRILL Version numbers requires an IETF Standards Action . ,302,6325,field
1010204,V,Version ( V ) is a 2-bit field . Version zero of TRILL is specified in this document . An RBridge RB1 MUST check the V field in a received TRILL-encapsulated frame . If the V field has a value not recognized by RB1   then RB1 MUST silently discard the frame . The allocation of new TRILL Version numbers requires an IETF Standards Action . ,302,6325,field
1010205,R,The two R bits are reserved for future use in extensions to this version zero of the TRILL protocol . They MUST be set to zero when the TRILL header is added by an ingress RBridge   transparently copied but otherwise ignored by transit RBridges   and ignored by egress RBridges . The allocation of reserved TRILL header bits requires an IETF Standards Action . ,500,6325,field
1010206,M,The Multi-destination bit ( see Section 2.4.2 ) indicates that the frame is to be delivered to a class of destination end stations via a distribution tree and that the egress RBridge nickname field specifies this tree . In particular : ,231,6325,field
1010207,Op-Length,There are provisions to express in the TRILL header that a frame is using an optional capability and to encode information into the header in connection with that capability . ,231,6325,field
1010208,Hop Count,The Hop Count field is a 6-bit unsigned integer . An Rbridge drops frames received with a hop count of zero   otherwise it decrements the hop count . ( This behavior is different from IPv4 and IPv6 in order to support the later addition of a traceroute-like facility that would be able to get a hop count exceeded from an egress RBridge .) ,231,6325,field
1010209,Egress RBridge Nickname,There are two cases for the contents of the egress RBridge nickname field   depending on the M bit ( see Section 3.4 ). The nickname is filled in by the ingress RBridge for TRILL Data frames and by the source RBridge for TRILL ESADI frames . ,231,6325,field
1010210,Ingress RBridge Nickname,The ingress RBridge nickname is set to a nickname of the ingress RBridge for TRILL Data frames and to a nickname of the source RBridge for TRILL ESADI frames . If the RBridge setting the ingress nickname has multiple nicknames   it SHOULD use the same nickname in the ingress field whenever it encapsulates a frame with any particular Inner.MacSA and Inner.VLAN value . This simplifies end node learning . ,231,6325,field
1010211,TRILL Header,o TRILL Header : Egress Nickname and Ingress Nickname . These specify nicknames of the egress and ingress RBridges   respectively   unless the frame is multi-destination   in which case the Egress Nickname specifies the distribution tree on which the frame is being sent . ,231,6325,field
1010212,Inner Ethernet Header,o Inner Ethernet Header : Inner Destination MAC Address ( Inner.MacDA ) and Inner Source MAC Address ( Inner.MacSA ): These addresses are as transmitted by the original end station   specifying   respectively   the destination and source of the inner frame . ,230,6325,field
1010213,Frame Check Sequence,Each Ethernet frame has a single Frame Check Sequence ( FCS ) that is computed to cover the entire frame   for detecting frame corruption due to bit errors on a link . Thus   when a frame is encapsulated   the original FCS is not included but is discarded .

The Prefix field has the number of bytes inferred from the Option Length field   that must be at least the Prefix Length . Note that in RPL   this means that the Prefix field may have lengths other than 0   8   or 16 . ,100,6550,field
1010607,Prf,Prf : 2-bit signed integer . The Route Preference indicates whether to prefer the router associated with this prefix over others   when multiple identical prefixes ( for different routers ) have been received . If the Reserved ( 10 ) value is received   the RIO MUST be ignored . Per [ RFC4191 ]  the Reserved ( 10 ) value MUST NOT be sent . ([ RFC4191 ] restricts the Preference to just three values to reinforce that it is not a metric .) ,301,6550,field

1010615,PCS,Path Control Size ( PCS ): 3-bit unsigned integer used to configure the number of bits that may be allocated to the Path Control field ( see Section 9.9 ). Note that when PCS is consulted to determine the width of the Path Control field   a value of 1 is added   i.e .  a PCS value of 0 results in 1 active bit in the Path Control field . The default value of PCS is DEFAULT_PATH_CONTROL_SIZE . ,400,6550,field
1010616,MaxRankIncrease,MaxRankIncrease : 16-bit unsigned integer used to configure DAGMaxRankIncrease   the allowable increase in Rank in support of local repair . If DAGMaxRankIncrease is 0   then this mechanism is disabled . ,231,6550,field

1010629,Path Control,Path Control : 8-bit bit field . The Path Control field limits the number of DAO parents to which a DAO message advertising connectivity to a specific destination may be sent   as well as providing some indication of relative preference . The limit provides some bound on overall DAO message fan-out in the LLN . The assignment and ordering of the bits in the Path Control also serves to communicate preference . Not all of these bits may be enabled as according to the PCS in the DODAG Configuration . The Path Control field is divided into four subfields that contain two bits each : PC1   PC2   PC3   and PC4   as illustrated in Figure 27 . The subfields are ordered by preference   with PC1 being the most preferred and PC4 being the least preferred . Within a subfield   there is no order of preference . By grouping the parents ( as in ECMP ) and ordering them   the parents may be associated with specific bits in the Path Control field in a way that communicates preference . ,400,6550,field
1010630,Path Sequence,Path Sequence : 8-bit unsigned integer .

1010632,Option Type,Option Type : 0x07 ,240,6550,field
1010633,Option Length,V : The ' V ' flag is the Version predicate . The Version predicate is true if the receiver's DODAGVersionNumber matches the requested Version Number . If the ' V ' flag is cleared   then the Version field is not valid and the Version field MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored upon receipt . ,210,6550,field
1010634,V,V : The ' V ' flag is the Version predicate . The Version predicate is true if the receiver's DODAGVersionNumber matches the requested Version Number . If the ' V ' flag is cleared   then the Version field is not valid and the Version field MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored upon receipt . ,210,6550,field
1010635,I,I : The ' I ' flag is the InstanceID predicate . The InstanceID predicate is true when the RPL node's current RPLInstanceID matches the requested RPLInstanceID . If the ' I ' flag is cleared   then the RPLInstanceID field is not valid and the RPLInstanceID field MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored upon receipt . ,210,6550,field
1010636,D,D : The ' D ' flag is the DODAGID predicate . The DODAGID predicate is true if the RPL node's parent set has the same DODAGID as the DODAGID field . If the ' D ' flag is cleared   then the DODAGID field is not valid and the DODAGID field MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored upon receipt . ,210,6550,field
1010637,Flags,Flags : The 5 bits remaining unused in the Flags field are reserved for flags . The field MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver . ,500,6550,field

1010640,DODAGID,DODAGID : 128-bit unsigned integer containing the DODAGID that is being solicited when valid . ,400,6550,field
1010641,Option Type,Option Length : 30 . Note that this length is expressed in units of single octets   unlike in IPv6 ND . ,100,6550,field
1010642,Option Length,Option Length : 30 . Note that this length is expressed in units of single octets   unlike in IPv6 ND . ,100,6550,field
1010643,Prefix Length,Prefix Length : 8-bit unsigned integer . The number of leading bits in the Prefix field that are valid . The value ranges from 0 to 128 . The Prefix Length field provides necessary information for on-link determination ( when combined with the ' L ' flag in the PIO ). It also assists with address autoconfiguration as specified in [ RFC4862 ]  for which there may be more restrictions on the prefix length . ,100,6550,field
1010644,L,L : 1-bit on-link flag . When set   it indicates that this prefix can be used for on-link determination . When not set   the advertisement makes no statement about on-link or off-link properties of the prefix . In other words   if the ' L ' flag is not set   a RPL node MUST NOT conclude that an address derived from the prefix is off-link . That is   it MUST NOT update a previous indication that the address is on-link . A RPL node acting as a router MUST NOT propagate a PIO with the ' L ' flag set . A RPL node acting as a router MAY propagate a PIO with the ' L ' flag not set . ,210,6550,field
1010645,A,A : 1-bit autonomous address-configuration flag . When set   it indicates that this prefix can be used for stateless address configuration as specified in [ RFC4862 ]. When both protocols ( ND RAs and RPL DIOs ) are used to carry PIOs on the same link   it is possible to use either one for SLAAC by a RPL node . It is also possible to make either protocol ineligible for SLAAC operation by forcing the ' A ' flag to 0 for PIOs carried in that protocol . ,210,6550,field
1010646,R,R : 1-bit router address flag . When set   it indicates that the Prefix field contains a complete IPv6 address assigned to the sending router that can be used as parent in a target option . The indicated prefix is the first prefix length bits of the Prefix field . The router IPv6 address has the same scope and conforms to the same lifetime values as the advertised prefix . This use of the Prefix field is compatible with its use in advertising the prefix itself   since Prefix Advertisement uses only the leading bits . Interpretation of this flag bit is thus independent of the processing required for the on-link ( L ) and autonomous address-configuration ( A ) flag bits . ,230,6550,field
1010647,Reserved,Reserved1 : 5-bit unused field . It MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver . ,500,6550,field
1010648,Valid Lifetime,Valid Lifetime : 32-bit unsigned integer . The length of time in seconds ( relative to the time the packet is sent ) that the prefix is valid for the purpose of on-link determination . A value of all one bits ( 0xFFFFFFFF ) represents infinity . The Valid Lifetime is also used by [ RFC4862 ]. ,120,6550,field
1010649,Preferred Lifetime,Preferred Lifetime : 32-bit unsigned integer . The length of time in seconds ( relative to the time the packet is sent ) that addresses generated from the prefix via stateless address autoconfiguration remain preferred [ RFC4862 ]. A value of all one bits ( 0xFFFFFFFF ) represents infinity . See [ RFC4862 ]. Note that the value of this field MUST NOT exceed the Valid Lifetime field to avoid preferring addresses that are no longer valid . ,100,6550,field
1010650,Reserved,Reserved2 : This field is unused . It MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver . ,500,6550,field
1010651,Prefix,Prefix : An IPv6 address or a prefix of an IPv6 address . The Prefix Length field contains the number of valid leading bits in the prefix . The bits in the prefix after the prefix length are reserved and MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver . A router SHOULD NOT send a prefix option for the link-local prefix   and a host SHOULD ignore such a prefix option . A non-storing node SHOULD refrain from advertising a prefix till it owns an address of that prefix   and then it SHOULD advertise its full address in this field   with the ' R ' flag set . The children of a node that so advertises a full address with the ' R ' flag set may then use that address to determine the content of the DODAG Parent Address subfield of the Transit Information option . ,230,6550,field
1010652,Option Type,Option Type : 0x09 ,240,6550,field

1010655,DAOSequence,DAOSequence : This sequence counter is present in the DAO Base to correlate a DAO message and a DAO ACK message . The DAOSequence number is locally significant to the node that issues a DAO message for its own consumption to detect the loss of a DAO message and enable retries . ,231,6550,field
1010656,Path Sequence,Path Sequence : This sequence counter is present in the Transit Information option in a DAO message . The purpose of this counter is to differentiate a movement where a newer route supersedes a stale one from a route redundancy scenario where multiple routes exist in parallel for the same target . The Path Sequence is globally significant in a DODAG and indicates the freshness of the route to the associated target . An older ( lesser ) value received from an originating router indicates that the originating router holds stale routing states and the originating router should not be considered anymore as a potential next hop for the target . The Path Sequence is computed by the node that advertises the target   that is the Target itself or a router that advertises a Target on behalf of a host   and is unchanged as the DAO content is propagated towards the root by parent routers . If a host does not pass a counter to its router   then the router is in charge of computing the Path Sequence on behalf of the host and the host can only register to one router for that purpose . If a DAO message containing the same Target is issued to multiple parents at a given point in time for the purpose of route redundancy   then the Path Sequence is the same in all the DAO messages for that same target . ,301,6550,field
1010657,DODAGID,DODAGID : The DODAGID is a Global or Unique Local IPv6 address of the root . A node that joins a DODAG SHOULD provision a host route via a DODAG parent to the address used by the root as the DODAGID . ,230,6550,field
1010658,Rank,1 . A node MUST NOT advertise a Rank less than or equal to any member of its parent set within the DODAG Version . ,231,6550,field
1010659,Path Control,A DAO message from a node contains one or more Target options . Each Target option specifies either a prefix advertised by the node   a prefix of addresses reachable outside the LLN   the address of a destination in the node's sub-DODAG   or a multicast group to which a node in the sub-DODAG is listening . The Path Control field of the Transit Information option allows nodes to request or allow for multiple Downward routes . A node constructs the Path Control field of a Transit Information option as follows : ,230,6550,field
1010660,Source Identifier,Source Identifier : 8 bytes . Source Identifier is set to the logical identifier of the originator of the protected packet . ,230,6550,field

1010666,RPLInstanceID,o RPLInstanceID [ DIO message   in DIO Base message ]. Although the RPLInstanceID must be configured on the DODAG root   it must also be configured as a policy on every node in order to determine whether or not the node should join a particular DODAG . Note that a second RPLInstanceID can be configured on the node   should it become root of a floating DODAG . ,303,6550,field

1010684,I,o I ( Included ): the ' I ' bit is only relevant when the node type is used as a constraint . For example   the path must only traverse mains-powered nodes . Conversely   battery-operated nodes must be excluded . The ' I ' bit is used to stipulate inclusion versus exclusion . When set   this indicates that nodes of the type specified in the node type field MUST be included . Conversely   when cleared   this indicates that nodes of type specified in the node type field MUST be excluded . ,210,6551,field
1010685,T,o T ( node Type ): 2-bit field indicating the node type . T=0 designates a mains-powered node   T=1 a battery-powered node   and T=2 a node powered by an energy scavenger . ,240,6551,field
1010686,E,o E ( Estimation ): when the ' E ' bit is set for a metric   the estimated percentage of remaining energy on the node is indicated in the E_E 8-bit field . When cleared   the estimated percentage of remaining energy is not provided . When the ' E ' bit is set for a constraint   the E_E field defines a threshold for the inclusion/ exclusion : if an inclusion   nodes with values higher than the threshold are to be included; if an exclusion   nodes with values lower than the threshold are to be excluded . ,210,6551,field
1010687,E_E,E_E ( Estimated-Energy ): 8-bit unsigned integer field indicating an estimated percentage of remaining energy . The E_E field is only relevant when the ' E ' flag is set   and it MUST be set to 0 when the ' E ' flag is cleared . ,210,6551,field
1010688,Throughput,Many LLNs support a wide range of throughputs . For some links   this may be due to variable coding . For the deeply duty-cycled links found in many LLNs   the variability comes as a result of trading power consumption for bit rate . There are several MAC layer protocols that allow for the effective bit rate of a link to vary over more than three orders of magnitude with a corresponding change in power consumption . For efficient operation   it may be desirable for nodes to report the range of throughput that their links can handle in addition to the currently available throughput . ,231,6551,field
1010689,Throughput,Throughput : 32 bits . The Throughput is encoded in 32 bits in unsigned integer format   expressed in bytes per second . ,400,6551,field
1010690,Latency,Similar to throughput   the latency of many LLN MAC sub-layers can vary over many orders of magnitude   again with a corresponding change in power consumption . Some LLN MAC link layers will allow the latency to be adjusted globally on the subnet   on a link-by-link basis   or not at all . Some will insist that it be fixed for a given link   but allow it to be variable from link to link . ,231,6551,field

For example   if there are 4 Locators in a Locator-Set   where the Weights assigned are 30   20   20   and 10   the first Locator will get 37.5% of the traffic   the 2nd and 3rd Locators will get 25% of the traffic   and the 4th Locator will get 12.5% of the traffic . If all Weights for a Locator-Set are equal   the receiver of the Map-Reply will decide how to load-split the traffic . See Section 6.5 for a suggested hash algorithm to distribute the load across Locators with the same Priority and equal Weight values . ,301,6830,field
1011189,M Priority,M Priority : Each RLOC is assigned a multicast Priority used by an ETR in a receiver multicast site to select an ITR in a source multicast site for building multicast distribution trees . A value of 255 means the RLOC MUST NOT be used for joining a multicast distribution tree . For more details   see [ RFC6831 ]. ,400,6830,field
1011190,M Weight,M Weight : When priorities are the same for multiple RLOCs   the Weight indicates how to balance building multicast distribution trees across multiple ITRs . The Weight is encoded as a relative weight ( similar to the unicast Weights ) of the total number of trees built to the source site identified by the EID-Prefix . If all Weights for a Locator-Set are equal   the receiver of the Map-Reply will decide how to distribute multicast state across ITRs . For more details   see [ RFC6831 ]. ,231,6830,field
1011191,Unused Flags,Unused Flags : These are set to 0 when sending and ignored on receipt . ,500,6830,field
1011192,L,L : When this bit is set   the Locator is flagged as a local Locator to the ETR that is sending the Map-Reply . When a Map-Server is doing proxy Map-Replying [ RFC6833 ] for a LISP site   the L-bit is set to 0 for all Locators in this Locator-Set . ,210,6830,field
1011193,p,p : When this bit is set   an ETR informs the RLOC-Probing ITR that the locator address for which this bit is set is the one being RLOC-probed and MAY be different from the source address of the Map-Reply . An ITR that RLOC-probes a particular Locator MUST use this Locator for retrieving the data structure used to store the fact that the Locator is reachable . The p-bit is set for a single Locator in the same Locator-Set . If an implementation sets more than one p-bit erroneously   the receiver of the Map-Reply MUST select the first Locator . The p-bit MUST NOT be set for Locator-Set records sent in Map-Request and Map-Register messages . ,210,6830,field
1011194,R,R : This is set when the sender of a Map-Reply has a route to the Locator in the Locator data record . This receiver may find this useful to know if the Locator is up but not necessarily reachable from the receiver's point of view . See also Section 6.4 for another way the R-bit may be used . ,201,6830,field
1011195,Locator,Locator : This is an IPv4 or IPv6 address ( as encoded by the ' Loc-AFI ' field ) assigned to an ETR . Note that the destination RLOC address MAY be an anycast address . A source RLOC can be an anycast address as well . The source or destination RLOC MUST NOT be the broadcast address ( 255.255.255.255 or any subnet broadcast address known to the router ) and MUST NOT be a link-local multicast address . The source RLOC MUST NOT be a multicast address . The destination RLOC SHOULD be a multicast address if it is being mapped from a multicast destination EID . ,230,6830,field

1011199,M,M : This is the want-map-notify bit . When set to 1   an ETR is requesting a Map-Notify message to be returned in response to sending a Map-Register message . The Map-Notify message sent by a Map-Server is used to acknowledge receipt of a Map-Register message . ,210,6830,field
1011200,Record Count,Record Count : This is the number of records in this Map-Register message . A record is comprised of that portion of the packet labeled ' Record ' above and occurs the number of times equal to Record Count . ,231,6830,field
1011201,Nonce,Nonce : This 8-octet ' Nonce ' field is set to 0 in Map-Register messages . Since the Map-Register message is authenticated   the ' Nonce ' field is not currently used for any security function but may be in the future as part of an anti-replay solution . ,500,6830,field
1011202,Key ID,Key ID : This is a configured ID to find the configured Message Authentication Code ( MAC ) algorithm and key value used for the authentication function . See Section 14.4 for codepoint assignments . ,230,6830,field
1011203,Authentication Data Length,Authentication Data Length : This is the length in octets of the ' Authentication Data ' field that follows this field . The length of the ' Authentication Data ' field is dependent on the MAC algorithm used . The length field allows a device that doesn't know the MAC algorithm to correctly parse the packet . ,100,6830,field
1011204,Authentication Data,Authentication Data : This is the message digest used from the output of the MAC algorithm . The entire Map-Register payload is authenticated with this field preset to 0 . After the MAC is computed   it is placed in this field . Implementations of this specification MUST include support for HMAC-SHA-1-96 [ RFC2404 ]  and support for HMAC-SHA-256-128 [ RFC4868 ] is RECOMMENDED . ,400,6830,field

1011209,IH,IH : The inner IPv4 or IPv6 header   which can use either RLOC or EID addresses in the header address fields . When a Map-Request is encapsulated in this packet format   the destination address in this header is an EID . ,230,6830,field
1011210,LCM,LCM : The format is one of the control message formats described in this section . At this time   only Map-Request messages are allowed to be encapsulated . In the future   PIM Join/Prune messages [ RFC6831 ] might be allowed . Encapsulating other types of LISP control messages is for further study . When Map-Requests are sent for RLOC-Probing purposes ( i.e .  the probe-bit is set )  they MUST NOT be sent inside Encapsulated Control Messages . ,301,6830,field

1011212,I,This field is used to indicate whether the delay metrics are Sampled   Interval or Cumulative metrics : ,301,6843,field
1011213,PT,Payload Type ( PT ): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this packet format is outside the scope of this document; it is either specified by the RTP profile under which this payload format is used or more likely signaled dynamically out-of-band ( e.g .  using SDP; Section 7.1.3 defines the name binding ). ,400,6849,field
1011214,M,Marker ( M ) bit : If the received RTP packet is looped back in multiple encapsulating RTP packets   the M bit is set to 1 in every fragment except the last packet; otherwise   it is set to 0 . ,210,6849,field
1011215,F,Possible values are First Fragment ( 00 )  Last Fragment ( 01 )  No Fragmentation ( 10 )  or Intermediate Fragment ( 11 ). This field identifies how much of the received packet is encapsulated in this packet by the loopback mirror . If the received packet is not fragmented   this field is set to 10; otherwise   the packet that contains the first fragments sets this field to 00 . The packet that contains the last fragment sets this field to 01   and all other packets set this field to 11 . ,240,6849,field
1011216,PT,Payload Type ( PT ): The assignment of an RTP payload type for the encapsulating packet format is outside the scope of this document; it is either specified by the RTP profile under which this payload format is used or more likely signaled dynamically out-of-band ( e.g .  using SDP; Section 7.2.3 defines the name binding ). ,400,6849,field
1011217,M,Extension ( X ) bit : This bit is defined by the RTP profile used . ,400,6849,field
1011218,m,m defines the length of the elements in the finite field   in bits . In this document   m is such that 2 <= m <= 16 . ,100,6865,field
1011219,S,o Strict ( S ) flag : when set to 1   this flag indicates that the E parameter is the actual encoding symbol length value for each block of the session ( unless otherwise notified by an updated FFCI if this possibility is considered by the use case or CDP ). When set to 0   this flag indicates that the E parameter is the maximum encoding symbol length value for each block of the session ( unless otherwise notified by an updated FFCI if this possibility is considered by the use case or CDP ). ,210,6865,field
1011220,m,o m parameter ( m ): an integer that defines the length of the elements in the finite field   in bits . We have : 2 <= m <= 16 . ,100,6865,field

1011224,m,o Encoding Symbol ID ( ESI ) ( m-bit field ): this field identifies the repair symbol contained in this FEC repair packet . This value is such that k <= ESI <= n - 1 for repair symbols . ,231,6865,field
1011225,S,o Strict ( S ) flag : flipping this S flag from 0 to 1 ( i.e .  E is now considered as a strict value ) enables an attacker to mislead the receiver if the actual symbol size varies over different source blocks . Flipping this S flag from 1 to 0 has no major consequences unless the receiver requires to have a fixed E value ( e.g .  because the receiver pre-allocates memory space ). ,210,6865,field

1011227,Message Type Vendor ID,This field indicates the owner of the namespace associated with the message type . This is accomplished by specifying the 24-bit Structure of Management Information ( SMI ) Private Enterprise Number [ PEN ] ( Vendor ID ) of the party who owns the message type namespace . Consistent with PA-TNC and PB-TNC   we depend on the PEN fitting in 24 bits   so if IANA were to register a wider PEN   then that PEN could not be used with NEA . IETF namespace PT-TLS Message Types MUST use zero ( 0 ) in this field . For more information about the intended use of NEA namespace identifiers   see the PA-TNC specification ( RFC 5792 )  Sections 2.1 and 2.2 . ,400,6876,field
1011228,Message Type,This field defines the type of the PT-TLS message within the scope of the specified Message Type Vendor ID that is included in the Message Value field . The specific IETF-defined values allowable in this field when the Message Type Vendor ID is the IETF SMI Private Enterprise Number value ( 0 ) are defined in Section 3.6 .

In such cases   the common prefix can be elided when specifying IPv6 addresses in the Start Point/End Point Address fields and the Address vector . The " Compr " field   a 4-bit unsigned integer   is set by the Start Point to specify the number of prefix octets that are elided from the IPv6 addresses in Start Point/End Point Address fields and the Address vector . The Start Point will set the Compr value to zero if full IPv6 addresses are to be carried in the Start Point Address/End Point Address fields and the Address vector . ,230,6998,field

Receipt of this Measurement Request would allow the Start Point to know the cost of the back route from the End Point to itself and thus determine the round-trip cost of reaching the End Point . ,302,6998,field
1011436,I,o Intermediate Reply ( I ): A value of 1 in this flag serves as permission to an Intermediate Point to generate a Measurement Reply if it knows the aggregated values of the routing metrics being measured for the rest of the route .

This flag MAY be set to one only if a Hop-by-hop Route with a global RPLInstanceID is being measured ( i.e .  H = 1 and RPLInstanceID has a global value ). Otherwise   this flag MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored on reception . ,302,6998,field

Enhanced AC-3 audio over RTP [ RFC4598 ] uses a dynamic channel transform mechanism . In order for the appropriate channel mapping to be determined   MOS metrics reports need to be tied to an RTP payload format . The reports should include the payload type of the reported media according to [ RFC6792 ]  so that it can be used to determine the appropriate channel mapping . ,400,7266,field
1012081,MOS Value,The estimated MOS for multimedia application performance is defined as including the effects of delay   loss   discard   jitter and other effects that would affect media quality .

1012133,PT,Payload Type ( PT ): 7 bits . This field identifies the format of the media payload   according to [ RFC3551 ]. This is the payload type of the RTP packet reported upon . The PT field is needed in the case where the MSAS is neither the media server nor a receiver of the media stream   i.e .  it is implemented as a third-party entity . In such cases   the MSAS needs the PT to determine the rate of advancement of the timestamps of the RTP media stream to be able to relate reports from different SCs on different RTP timestamp values . ,400,7272,field
1012134,Resrv,Reserved bits ( Resrv ): 25 bits . These bits are reserved for future use and SHALL be set to 0 at transmission and MUST be ignored by the receiver . ,500,7272,field

Several consecutive RTP packets will have equal timestamps if they are ( logically ) generated at once   e.g .  belong to the same video frame . It may well be the case that one receiver reports on the first RTP packet that has a certain RTP timestamp   and a second receiver reports on the last RTP packet that has that same RTP timestamp . This would lead to an error in the ,121,7272,field
1012137,Packet Presented NTP timestamp,Packet Presented NTP timestamp : 32 bits . This timestamp reflects the wallclock time at the moment the rendered media unit ( e.g .  video frame or audio sample ) contained in the first byte of the associated RTP packet is presented to the user . It is based on the time format used by NTP and consists of the least significant 16 bits of the NTP seconds part and the most significant 16 bits of the NTP fractional second part . If no Packet Presented NTP timestamp is available   this field SHALL be set to 0 and be considered empty   and the Packet Presented NTP timestamp flag ( P ) SHALL be set to 0 . With regards to NTP epoch and rollover   the value of the Packet Presented NTP timestamp is considered to always be greater than the Packet Received NTP timestamp and to be within 2^16 seconds of it . Presented in this context means the moment the data is played out to the user of the system   i.e .  sound played out through speakers   video images being displayed on some display   etc . The accuracy resulting from the synchronization algorithm will only be as good as the accuracy with which the SCs can determine the delay between receiving packets and presenting them to the end user . If no presentation timestamps are reported by SCs   the ability to accurately synchronize playout may be limited . ,121,7272,field

1012706,Reserved,Reserved : Reserved MUST be set to 0 when the subobject is inserted in the RRO   MUST NOT be changed when a node processes the RRO   and MUST be ignored on the node addressed by the preceding RRO subobjects . ,500,7570,field
1012707,HANDSHAKE,For Peer P to establish communication with Peer Q in Swarm S   the peers must first exchange HANDSHAKE messages by means of a handshake procedure . The initiating Peer P needs to know the metadata of Swarm S   which consists of : ,400,7574,field
1012708,HAVE,The HAVE message is used to convey which chunks a peer has available for download . The set of chunks it has available may be expressed using different chunk addressing and availability map compression schemes   described in Section 4 . HAVE messages can be used both for sending a complete overview of a peer's chunk availability as well as for updates to that set . ,400,7574,field
1012709,DATA,The DATA message is used to transfer chunks of content . The DATA message MUST contain the chunk ID of the chunk and chunk itself . A peer MAY send the DATA messages for multiple chunks in the same datagram . The DATA message MAY contain additional information if needed by the specific congestion control mechanism used . At present   PPSPP uses LEDBAT [ RFC6817 ] for congestion control   which requires the current system time to be sent along with the DATA message   so the current system time MUST be included . ,301,7574,field
1012710,ACK,ACK messages MUST be sent to acknowledge received chunks if PPSPP is run over an unreliable transport protocol . ACK messages MAY be sent if a reliable transport protocol is used . In the former case   a receiving peer that has successfully checked the integrity of a chunk   or interval of chunks C   MUST send an ACK message containing a chunk specification for C . As LEDBAT is used   an ACK message MUST contain the one-way delay   computed from the peer's current system time received in the DATA message . A peer MAY delay sending ACK messages as defined in the LEDBAT specification [ RFC6817 ]. ,303,7574,field
1012711,REQUEST,While bulk download protocols normally do explicit requests for certain ranges of data ( i.e .  use a pull model   for example   BitTorrent [ BITTORRENT ])  live streaming protocols quite often use a push model without requests to save round trips . PPSPP supports both models of operation . ,400,7574,field
1012712,PEX_REQ,Peer Exchange ( PEX ) messages are common in many peer-to-peer protocols . They allow peers to exchange the transport addresses of the peers they are currently interacting with   thereby reducing the need to contact a central tracker ( or Distributed Hash Table ) to discovery new peers . The strength of this mechanism is therefore that it enables decentralized peer discovery : after an initial bootstrap   a central tracker is no longer needed . Its weakness is that it enables a number of attacks   so it should not be used on the Internet unless extra security measures are in place . ,231,7574,field
1012713,Protocol Options,The HANDSHAKE message in PPSPP can contain the following protocol options . Unless stated otherwise   a protocol option consists of an 8-bit code followed by an 8-bit value . Larger values are all encoded ,231,7574,field
1012714,Version,A peer MUST include the maximum version of the PPSPP it supports as the first protocol option in the list . The code for this option is 0 . Defined values are listed in Table 3 . ,220,7574,field
1012715,Chunk Size,A peer in a swarm MUST include the chunk size the swarm uses . The code for this option is 9 . Its value is a 32-bit integer denoting the size of the chunks in bytes in big-endian format . When variable chunk sizes are used   this option MUST be set to the special value 0xFFFFFFFF . Section 8.1 explains how content publishers can determine a value for this option . ,100,7574,field
1012716,Chunk Size,In general   a UDP datagram containing PPSPP messages SHOULD fit inside a single IP packet   so its maximum size depends on the MTU of the network . If the UDP datagram does not fit   its chance of getting lost in the network increases as the loss of a single fragment of the datagram causes the loss of the complete datagram . ,400,7574,field
1012717,HANDSHAKE,A channel is established with a handshake . To start a handshake   the initiating peer needs to know the swarm metadata   defined in Section 3.1 and the IP address and UDP port of a peer . A datagram containing a HANDSHAKE message then looks as follows : ,400,7574,field
1012718,Protocol Options,Protocol Options : A list of protocol options encoding the swarm's metadata   as defined in Section 7 . ,400,7574,field
1012719,HAVE,A HAVE message ( type 0x03 ) consists of a single chunk specification that states that the sending peer has those chunks and successfully checked their integrity . The single chunk specification represents a consecutive range of verified chunks . A bin consists of a single integer   and a chunk or byte range of two integers   of the width specified by the Chunk Addressing protocol options   encoded big - endian . ,400,7574,field
1012720,DATA,A DATA message ( type 0x01 ) consists of a chunk specification   a timestamp   and the actual chunk . In case a datagram contains one DATA message   a sender MUST always put the DATA message in the tail of the datagram . A datagram MAY contain multiple DATA messages when the chunk size is fixed and when none of the DATA messages carry the last chunk   if that is smaller than the chunk size . As LEDBAT congestion control is used   a sender MUST include a timestamp   in ,400,7574,field
1012721,ACK,An ACK message ( type 0x02 ) acknowledges data that was received from its addressee; to comply with the LEDBAT delay-based congestion control   an ACK message consists of a chunk specification and a timestamp representing a one-way delay sample . The one-way delay sample is a 64-bit integer with microsecond accuracy   and it is computed from the timestamp received from the previous DATA message containing the chunk being acknowledged following the LEDBAT specification . ,110,7574,field
1012722,REQUEST,A REQUEST message ( type 0x08 ) consists of a chunk specification for the chunks the requester wants to download . ,400,7574,field
1012723,PEX_REQ,A PEX_REQ ( 0x06 ) message has no payload . A PEX_RESv4 ( 0x05 ) message consists of an IPv4 address in big-endian format followed by a UDP port number in big-endian format . A PEX_RESv6 ( 0x0c ) message contains a 128-bit IPv6 address instead of an IPv4 one . If a PEX_REQ message does not originate from a private   unique-local   link-local   or multicast address [ RFC1918 ] [ RFC4193 ] [ RFC4291 ]  then the PEX_RES* messages sent in reply MUST NOT contain such addresses . This is to prevent leaking of internal addresses to external peers . ,400,7574,field
1012724,Version,Version : 1 ,220,7574,field
1012725,Chunk Size,The receiving peer MAY respond   in which case the returned datagram MUST consist of the channel ID from the sender's HANDSHAKE message ( 0x00000001 ); a HANDSHAKE message   whose payload is a locally unused; a random channel ID ( 0x00000008 ); and a list of protocol options; followed by any other messages it wants to send . ,303,7574,field
1012726,HANDSHAKE,o Secured against DoS Amplification attacks as described in Section 12.1 . ,400,7574,field
1012727,HAVE,o Threat HAVE.1 : Malicious Peer T can claim to have content that it does not . Subsequently   Peer T won't respond to requests . ,302,7574,field
1012728,DATA,o Threat DATA.1 : Peer T sending bogus chunks . ,240,7574,field
1012729,ACK,o Threat ACK.1 : Peer T acknowledges wrong chunks . ,210,7574,field
1012730,REQUEST,o Threat REQUEST.1 : Peer T could request lots from Peer A   leaving Peer A without resources for others . ,240,7574,field
1012731,Encoding,This section provides encodings for the information elements defined in [ RFC7446 ] that have applicability to WSON . The encodings are designed to be suitable for use in the GMPLS routing protocols OSPF [ RFC4203 ] and IS-IS [ RFC5307 ] and in the PCE Communication Protocol ( PCEP ) [ RFC5440 ]. Note that the information distributed in [ RFC4203 ] and [ RFC5307 ] is arranged via the nesting of sub-TLVs within TLVs; this document defines elements to be used within such constructs . Specific constructs of sub-TLVs and the nesting of sub-TLVs of the information element defined by this document will be defined in the respective protocol enhancement documents . ,400,7579,field

1012736,Link Set Field,We will frequently need to describe properties of groups of links . To do so efficiently   we can make use of a link set concept similar to the label set concept of [ RFC3471 ].

The bitmap is in ascending order   with the leftmost bit representing priority level 0 ( i.e .  the highest ) and the rightmost bit representing priority level 7 ( i.e .  the lowest ). A bit MUST be set ( 1 ) corresponding to each priority represented in the sub-TLV and MUST NOT be set ( 0 ) when the corresponding priority is not represented . If a label is available at priority M   it MUST be advertised available at each priority N < M . At least one priority level MUST be advertised . ,231,7579,field
1012744,PRI,PRI ( Priority Flags   8 bits ): A bitmap used to indicate which priorities are being advertised . The bitmap is in ascending order   with the leftmost bit representing priority level 0 ( i.e .  the highest ) and the rightmost bit representing priority level 7 ( i.e .  the lowest ). A bit MUST be set ( 1 ) corresponding to each priority represented in the sub-TLV and MUST NOT be set ( 0 ) when the corresponding priority is not represented . If a label is available at priority M   it MUST be advertised available at each priority N < M . At least one priority level MUST be advertised . ,231,7579,field
1012745,Label Set Field,The Label Set Field is used within the Available Labels Field or the Shared Backup Labels Field   defined in Sections 2.4 and 2.5   respectively . It is also used within SIMPLE_LABEL   LABEL_RANGE   or SIMPLE_LABEL & CHANNEL_COUNT   defined in Sections 2.2.1   2.2.3   and 2.2.4   respectively . ,400,7579,field
1012746,4,Num Labels is generally the number of labels . It has a specific meaning depending on the Action value . See Sections 2.6.1   2.6.2   and 2.6.3 for details . Num Labels is a 12-bit integer . ,231,7579,field
1012747,Link Set Field,Suppose that we wish to describe a set of input ports that have link local identifiers numbered 3 through 42 . In the Link Set Field   we set Action = 1 to denote an inclusive range   Dir = 1 to denote input links   and Format = 0 to denote link local identifiers . Thus   we have : ,240,7579,field
1012748,Label Set Field,In this example   we use a 40-channel C-Band Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing ( DWDM ) system with 100 GHz spacing with lowest frequency 192.0 THz ( 1561.4 nm ) and highest frequency 195.9 THz ( 1530.3 nm ). These frequencies correspond to n = - 11 and n = 28   respectively . Now suppose the following channels are available : ,400,7579,field

1012854,Reserved,o F-flag : 1-bit field that specifies whether the rule is to be used for forwarding ( FMR ). If set   this rule is used as an FMR; if not set   this rule is a BMR only and MUST NOT be used for forwarding . Note : A BMR can also be used as an FMR for forwarding if the F-flag is set . The BMR is determined by a longest-prefix match of the Rule IPv6 prefix against the End-user IPv6 prefix(es ). ,210,7598,field
1012855,F,o F-flag : 1-bit field that specifies whether the rule is to be used for forwarding ( FMR ). If set   this rule is used as an FMR; if not set   this rule is a BMR only and MUST NOT be used for forwarding . Note : A BMR can also be used as an FMR for forwarding if the F-flag is set . The BMR is determined by a longest-prefix match of the Rule IPv6 prefix against the End-user IPv6 prefix(es ). ,210,7598,field
1012856,PSID,o PSID-len : 8 bits long; specifies the number of significant bits in the PSID field ( also known as ' k '). When set to 0   the PSID field is to be ignored . After the first ' a ' bits   there are k bits in the port number representing the value of the PSID . Consequently   the address-sharing ratio would be 2^k . ,210,7598,field
1012857,PSID,o PSID : 16 bits long . The PSID value algorithmically identifies a set of ports assigned to a CE . The first k bits on the left of this field contain the PSID binary value . The remaining ( 16 - k ) bits on the right are padding zeros . ,400,7598,field
1012858,Version,The Version field indicates the format of the internet header . This document describes version 4 . ,220,760,field
1012859,IHL,tInternet Header Length is the length of the internet header in 32 bit words   and thus points to the beginning of the data . Note that the minimum value for a correct header is 5 . ,100,760,field
1012860,Type of Service,The Type of Service provides an indication of the abstract parameters of the quality of service desired . These parameters are to be used to guide the selection of the actual service parameters when transmitting a datagram through a particular network . Several networks offer service precedence   which somehow treats high precedence traffic as more important than other traffic . A few networks offer a Stream service   whereby one can achieve a smoother service at some cost . Typically this involves the reservation of resources within the network . Another choice involves a low-delay vs . high-reliability trade off . Typically networks invoke more complex ( and delay producing ) mechanisms as the need for reliability increases . ,240,760,field
1012861,Total Length,Total Length is the length of the datagram   measured in octets   including internet header and data . This field allows the length of a datagram to be up to 65 535 octets . Such long datagrams are impractical for most hosts and networks . All hosts must be prepared to accept datagrams of up to 576 octets ( whether they arrive whole ,100,760,field
1012862,Identification,An identifying value assigned by the sender to aid in assembling the fragments of a datagram . ,400,760,field
1012863,Flags,Various Control Flags . ,231,760,field
1012864,Fragment Offset,This field indicates where in the datagram this fragment belongs . The fragment offset is measured in units of 8 octets ( 64 bits ). The first fragment has offset zero . ,110,760,field
1012865,Time to Live,This field indicates he maximum time the datagram is allowed to remain the internet system . If this field contains the value zero   then the datagram should be destroyed . This field is modified in internet header processing . The time is measured in units of seconds . The intention is to cause undeliverable datagrams to be discarded . ,122,760,field
1012866,Protocol,This field indicates the next level protocol used in the data portion of the internet datagram . The values for various protocols are specified in reference [ 6 ]. ,231,760,field
1012867,Header Checksum,A checksum on the header only . Since some header fields may change ( e.g .  time to live )  this is recomputed and verified at each point that the internet header is processed . ,301,760,field

1012869,Destination Address,The destination address . The first octet is the Destination Network   and the following three octets are the Destination Local Address . ,230,760,field
1012870,Options,The option field is variable in length . There may be zero or more options . There are two cases for the format of an option : ,400,760,field
1012871,Version,Version : Same as the datagram in error . IHL : As computed . Type of Service : Zero . Total Length : As computed . Identification : A new identification is selected . Flags : Zero . Fragment Offset : Zero . Time to Live : Sixty . Protocol : Same as the datagram in error . Header Checksum : As computed . Source Address : Address of the error reporting module . Destination Address : Source address of the datagram in error . Options : The General Error Report Option . Padding : As needed . ,110,760,field
1012872,Padding,The internet header padding is used to ensure that the internet header ends on a 32 bit boundary . The padding is zero . ,302,760,field
1012873,Identification,The choice of the Identifier for a datagram is based on the need to provide a way to uniquely identify the fragments of a particular datagram . The protocol module assembling fragments judges fragments to belong to the same datagram if they have the same source   destination   protocol   and Identifier . Thus   the sender must choose the Identifier to be unique for this source   destination pair and protocol for the time the datagram ( or any fragment of it ) could be alive in the internet . ,231,760,field
1012874,Type of Service,The type of service ( TOS ) is for internet service quality selection . The type of service is specified along the abstract parameters precedence   reliability   and speed . A further concern is the possibility of efficient handling of streams of datagrams . These abstract parameters are to be mapped into the actual service parameters of the particular networks the datagram traverses . ,231,760,field
1012875,Time to Live,The time to live is set by the sender to the maximum time the datagram is allowed to be in the internet system . If the datagram is in the internet system longer than the time to live   then the datagram should be destroyed . This field should be decreased at each point that the internet header is processed to reflect the time spent processing the datagram . Even if no local information is available on the time actually spent   the field should be decremented by 1 . The time is measured in units of seconds ( i.e . the value 1 means one second ). Thus   the maximum time to live is 255 seconds or 4.25 minutes . ,122,760,field
1012876,Options,The options are just that   optional . That is   the presence or absence of an option is the choice of the sender   but each internet module must be able to parse every option . There can be several options present in the option field . ,400,760,field
1012877,encapsulated 4rd rule options,o encapsulated 4rd rule options : The OPTION_4RD DHCPv6 option contains at least one encapsulated OPTION_4RD_MAP_RULE option and a maximum of one encapsulated OPTION_4RD_NON_MAP_RULE option . Since DHCP servers normally send whatever options the operator configures   operators are advised to configure these options appropriately . DHCP servers MAY check to see that the configuration follows these rules and notify the operator in an implementation-dependent manner if the settings for these options aren't valid . The length of encapsulated options is in octets . ,240,7600,field
1012878,W,o W : WKP authorized   = 1 if set ,302,7600,field

1012881,Link number,o Link number : This is a 1-byte value that identifies an SMC-R link within a link group . Both the server and the client use this number to distinguish an SMC-R link from other links within the same link group . It is only unique within a link group . In order to prevent timing windows that may occur when a server creates a new link while the client is still cleaning up a previously existing link   link numbers cannot be reused until the entire link numbering space has been exhausted . ,231,7609,field
1012882,Instance ID,A 2-byte instance count that ensures that if the same RNIC MAC is later used in the peer ID for a different TCP/IP stack -- for example   if an RNIC is redeployed to another stack -- the values are unique .

1012942,Producer cursor wrap seqno,A 2-byte unsigned integer that represents a wrapping counter incremented by the producer whenever the data written into this RMBE receive buffer causes a wrap ( i.e .  the producer cursor wraps ). This is used by the receiver to determine when new data is available even though the cursors appear unchanged   such as when a full window size write is completed ( producer cursor of this RMBE sent by peer = local consumer cursor ) or in scenarios where the producer cursor sent for this RMBE < local consumer cursor . ,301,7609,field
1012943,Producer Cursor,A 4-byte unsigned integer that is a wrapping offset into the RMBE data area . Points to the next byte of data to be written by the sender . Can advance up to the receiver's consumer cursor as known by the sender . When the urgent data present indicator is on   points 1 byte beyond the last byte of urgent data . When computing this cursor   the presence of the eye catcher in the RMBE data area must be accounted for .

1012954,Checksum,The checksum field is the 16 bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of all 16 bit words in the header and text . If a segment contains an odd number of header and text octets to be checksummed   the last octet is padded on the right with zeros to form a 16 bit word for checksum purposes . The pad is not transmitted as part of the segment . While computing the checksum   the checksum field itself is replaced with zeros . ,301,761,field
1012955,Urgent Pointer,This field communicates the current value of the urgent pointer as a positive offset from the sequence number in this segment . The urgent pointer points to the sequence number of the octet following the urgent data . This field should only be interpreted in segments with the URG control bit set . ,110,761,field
1012956,Options,Options may occupy space at the end of the TCP header and are a multiple of 8 bits in length . All options are included in the checksum . An option may begin on any octet boundary . There are two cases for the format of an option : ,110,761,field

1013054,PauseID,All messages defined in this specification ( Section 8 ) contain a PauseID   satisfying the design consideration on sequence numbering ( Section 4.7 ). This PauseID is scoped by and thus a property of the targeted RTP stream ( SSRC ) and is not only a sequence number for individual messages . Instead   it numbers an entire " pause and resume operation " for the RTP stream   typically keeping PauseID constant for multiple   related messages . The PauseID value used during such operation is called the current PauseID . A new " pause and resume operation " is defined to start when the RTP stream sender resumes the RTP stream after it was being paused . The current PauseID is then incremented by one in modulo arithmetic . In the subsequent descriptions below   it is sometimes necessary to refer to PauseID values that were already used as the current PauseID   which is denoted as the past PauseID . It should be noted that since PauseID uses modulo arithmetic   a past PauseID may have a larger value than the current PauseID . Since PauseID uses modulo arithmetic   it is also useful to define what PauseID values are considered " past " to clearly separate it from what could be considered " future " PauseID values . Half of the entire PauseID value range is chosen to represent a past PauseID   while a quarter of the PauseID value range is chosen to represent future values . The remaining quarter of the PauseID value range is intentionally left undefined in that respect . ,400,7728,field

1013607,IHL,Internet Header Length is the length of the internet header in 32 bit words   and thus points to the beginning of the data . Note that the minimum value for a correct header is 5 . ,100,791,field
1013608,Type of Service,The Type of Service provides an indication of the abstract parameters of the quality of service desired . These parameters are to be used to guide the selection of the actual service parameters when transmitting a datagram through a particular network . Several networks offer service precedence   which somehow treats high precedence traffic as more important than other traffic ( generally by accepting only traffic above a certain precedence at time of high load ). The major choice is a three way tradeoff between low-delay   high-reliability   and high-throughput . ,240,791,field
1013609,Total Length,Total Length is the length of the datagram   measured in octets   including internet header and data . This field allows the length of a datagram to be up to 65 535 octets . Such long datagrams are impractical for most hosts and networks . All hosts must be prepared to accept datagrams of up to 576 octets ( whether they arrive whole or in fragments ). It is recommended that hosts only send datagrams larger than 576 octets if they have assurance that the destination is prepared to accept the larger datagrams . ,100,791,field

1013613,Time to Live,This field indicates the maximum time the datagram is allowed to remain in the internet system . If this field contains the value zero   then the datagram must be destroyed . This field is modified in internet header processing . The time is measured in units of seconds   but since every module that processes a datagram must decrease the TTL by at least one even if it process the datagram in less than a second   the TTL must be thought of only as an upper bound on the time a datagram may exist . The intention is to cause undeliverable datagrams to be discarded   and to bound the maximum datagram lifetime . ,122,791,field
1013614,Protocol,This field indicates the next level protocol used in the data portion of the internet datagram . The values for various protocols are specified in " Assigned Numbers " [ 9 ]. ,231,791,field

1013619,Padding,The internet header padding is used to ensure that the internet header ends on a 32 bit boundary . The padding is zero . ,302,791,field
1013620,Identification,The choice of the Identifier for a datagram is based on the need to provide a way to uniquely identify the fragments of a particular datagram . The protocol module assembling fragments judges fragments to belong to the same datagram if they have the same source   destination   protocol   and Identifier . Thus   the sender must choose the Identifier to be unique for this source   destination pair and protocol for the time the datagram ( or any fragment of it ) could be alive in the internet . ,231,791,field
1013621,Type of Service,The type of service ( TOS ) is for internet service quality selection . The type of service is specified along the abstract parameters precedence   delay   throughput   and reliability . These abstract parameters are to be mapped into the actual service parameters of the particular networks the datagram traverses . ,231,791,field
1013622,Time to Live,The time to live is set by the sender to the maximum time the datagram is allowed to be in the internet system . If the datagram is in the internet system longer than the time to live   then the datagram must be destroyed . ,122,791,field
1013623,Options,The options are optional in each datagram   but required in implementations . That is   the presence or absence of an option is the choice of the sender   but each internet module must be able to parse every option . There can be several options present in the option field . ,400,791,field

For example   in a host multihoming context   certain IP addresses may need to be associated with certain ESP SPIs to avoid violating the ESP anti-replay window . Addresses may also be affiliated with transport ports in certain tunneling scenarios . Locators may simply be traditional network addresses .

1014428,Reserved,Reserved : 16 bits ( unsigned integer ) This field is reserved . It MUST be set to 0 by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver . ,500,8260,field
1014429,Message Identifier,Message Identifier ( MID ): 32 bits ( unsigned integer ) The MID is the same for all fragments of a user message; it is used to determine which fragments ( enumerated by the FSN ) belong to the same user message . For ordered user messages   the MID is also used by the SCTP receiver to deliver the user messages in the correct order to the upper layer ( similar to the SSN of the DATA chunk defined in [ RFC4960 ]). The sender uses two counters for each outgoing stream : one for ordered messages and one for unordered messages . All of these counters are independent and initially 0 . They are incremented by 1 for each user message . Please note that the serial number arithmetic defined in [ RFC1982 ] using SERIAL_BITS = 32 applies . Therefore   the sender MUST NOT have more than 2**31 - 1 ordered messages for each outgoing stream in flight and MUST NOT have more than 2**31 - 1 unordered messages for each outgoing stream in flight . A message is considered in flight if at least one of its I-DATA chunks is not acknowledged in a way that cannot be reneged ( i.e .  not acknowledged by the cumulative TSN Ack ). Please note that the MID is in " network byte order "  a.k.a . Big Endian . ,231,8260,field
1014430,Payload Protocol Identifier,Payload Protocol Identifier ( PPID ) / Fragment Sequence Number ( FSN ): 32 bits ( unsigned integer ) If the B bit is set   this field contains the PPID of the user message . Note that in this case   this field is not touched by an SCTP implementation; therefore   its byte order is not necessarily in network byte order . The upper layer is responsible for any byte order conversions to this field   similar to the PPID of DATA chunks . In this case   the FSN is implicitly considered to be 0 . If the B bit is not set   this field contains the FSN . The FSN is used to enumerate all fragments of a single user message   starting from 0 and incremented by 1 . The last fragment of a message MUST have the E bit set . Note that the FSN MAY wrap completely multiple times   thus allowing arbitrarily large user messages . For the FSN   the serial number arithmetic defined in [ RFC1982 ] applies with SERIAL_BITS = 32 . Therefore   a sender MUST NOT have more than 2**31 - 1 fragments of a single user message in flight . A fragment is considered in flight if it is not acknowledged in a way that cannot be reneged . Please note that the FSN is in " network byte order "  a.k.a . Big Endian . ,400,8260,field
1014431,New Cumulative TSN,New Cumulative TSN : 32 bits ( unsigned integer ) This indicates the New Cumulative TSN to the data receiver . Same as the New Cumulative TSN for FORWARD TSN chunks   as specified in [ RFC3758 ]. ,231,8260,field

1014434,Message Identifier,Message Identifier ( MID ): 32 bits ( unsigned integer ) This field holds the largest Message Identifier for ordered or unordered messages indicated by the U bit that was skipped for the stream specified by the Stream Identifier . For ordered messages   this is similar to the FORWARD-TSN chunk   just replacing the 16-bit SSN by the 32-bit MID . ,230,8260,field
